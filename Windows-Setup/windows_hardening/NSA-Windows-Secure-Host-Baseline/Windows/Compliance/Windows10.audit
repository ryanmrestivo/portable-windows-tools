The Current Branch (CB) is the only option for consumer versions and will be maintained for approximately 4 months before a new CB is declared. Only the current CB is serviced with updates. Professional and Enterprise versions may select the Current Branch for Business (CBB) which is declared at the end of a Current Branch period and will be maintained for approximately 8 additional months.  There will only be 2 CBBs active at any given time which will be serviced with updates. A separate servicing branch intended for special purpose systems is the Long-Term Servicing Branch which will receive security updates for 10 years but excludes feature updates.
