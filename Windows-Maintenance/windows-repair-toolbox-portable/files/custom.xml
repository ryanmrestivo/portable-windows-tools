<!--INSTRUCIONS (start):

1 - Use the "Eset Online Scanner" line as a model for you to copy & paste, while adapting it to your needs (check lines 22 and 23). 
	To do that, in each new line you add, change what's in front of title=, link= and exe= . 
	You can add as many tools as you'd like. 
	
	Attention: only direct download links will work (links that end with the name and extension of the file you want to download. Example: https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z1900.exe). 
	If the tool you want to add doesn't have a direct download link, it's possible, for instance, for you to use your own server or, alternatively, a file hosting service that allows you to create direct download links.

2 - Next to "title", add the name of the tool.
    Next to "link", add the complete download link.
    Next to "exe", add the name of the file including the extension (it's not mandatory to be an .exe file, it can be any other kind of file, like a .bat, .cmd, .zip, etc.)
   
3 - Save this file and close it. Don't change its name or extension (custom.xml).
