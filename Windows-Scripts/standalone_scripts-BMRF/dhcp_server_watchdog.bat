:: Purpose:       DHCP server Watchdog & Failover script. Read notes below
:: Requirements:  1. Domain administrator credentials & "Logon as a batch job" rights
::                2. Proper firewall configuration to allow connection
::                3. Proper permissions on the DHCP backup directory
:: Author:        vocatus on reddit.com/r/sysadmin ( vocatus.gate@gmail.com ) // PGP key ID: 0x07d1490f82a211a2
:: Version:       1.3.1 * Rename VERSION and UPDATED to SCRIPT_VERSION and SCRIPT_UPDATED, respectively
::                1.0.0   Initial write
:: Notes:         I wrote this script after failing to find a satisfactory method of performing
::                watchdog/failover between two Windows Server 2008 R2 DHCP servers.
::
::                This script has two modes: "Watchdog" and "Failover." 
::                - Watchdog checks the status of the remote DHCP service, logs it, and then grabs the remote DHCP db backup file and imports it.
::                - Failover mode is activated when the script cannot determine the status of the remote DHCP server. The script then activates 
::                  the local DHCP server with the latest backup copy it successfully retrieved from the primary server.
::
:: Instructions:  1. Tune the variables in this script to your desired backup location and frequency
::                2. On the primary server: set the DHCP backup interval to your desired backup frequency. The value is in minutes; I recommend 5 minutes.
::                   You do this by modifying this registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DHCPServer\Parameters\BackupInterval
::                3. On the backup server:  set this script to run as a scheduled task. I recommend every 10 minutes. 
:: Notice:
::               !! Make sure to set it only to run if it isn't already running! If there is a failover you could have 
::                  Task Scheduler spawn a new instance of the script every n minutes and end up with hundreds of copies
::                  of this script running.

:::::::::::::::
:: VARIABLES :: -------------- These are the defaults. Change them if you so desire. --------- ::
:::::::::::::::
:: Rules for variables:
::  * NO quotes!                       (bad:  "c:\directory\path"       )
::  * NO trailing slashes on the path! (bad:   c:\directory\            )
::  * Spaces are okay                  (okay:  c:\my folder\with spaces )
::  * Network paths are okay           (okay:  \\server\share name      )
::                                     (       \\172.16.1.5\share name  )
:: Remote server is the PRIMARY DHCP server we're watching. Use a hostname or IP address.
set REMOTE_SERVER=YOUR-DHCP-SERVER

:: Location of the automatic DHCP backup file on the primary server. Windows generates this automatically.
:: Best practice is to leave this alone, unless you have a custom backup location.
:: The script builds the backup line like this: \\%REMOTE_SERVER%\c$\%REMOTE_BACKUP_PATH%
set REMOTE_BACKUP_PATH=Windows\system32\dhcp\backup

:: Location of the operational DHCP database files on the remote (primary) server.
:: Best practice is to leave this alone, unless you have a custom location. Changing this will break the 
:: function that re-uploads the most current db back to the primary server after a failure. This doesn't 
:: ruin the script, but if the backup server passed out any IP's while the primary server was down, the 
:: primary server won't know about them when it comes back up.
set REMOTE_OPERATING_PATH=Windows\system32\dhcp

:: Location of your backup/standby file. I normally copy directly to my backup server's DHCP directory. 
:: The script builds the local backup line like this: c:\windows\system32\dhcp\[backup folders]
set LOCAL_BACKUP_PATH=%SystemRoot%\system32\dhcp

:: When a failover is triggered, how many seconds should we wait in between each attempt to contact the primary server again?
set FAILOVER_RECHECK_DELAY=10

:: Log options. Don't put an extension on the log file name. (Important!) The script sets this later on.
set LOGPATH=%SystemDrive%\Logs
set LOGFILE=%COMPUTERNAME%_DHCP_watchdog

:: Max log file size allowed (in bytes) before rotation and archive. I recommend setting this to 2 MB (2097152).
:: Example: 524288 is half a megabyte (~500KB)
set LOG_MAX_SIZE=10485760
