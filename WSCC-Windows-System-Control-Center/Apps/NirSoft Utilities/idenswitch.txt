Introduction
============

Starting from version 5.0, Outlook Express allows you to create multiple
identities, where every identity has a separate address book, inbox and
other folders. However, in order to switch to other identity, you have to
open Outlook Express with the current identity, select 'Switch Identity'
from the File menu, and then select the desired identity.

This utility allows you to instantly open Outlook Express with the
desired identity, without opening Outlook Express at first.
It provides 2 methods to do that:
1. You can simply select the desired identity from the main window of
   IdenSwitch, and then click the 'Switch' button.
2. You can create special shortcuts on your desktop that will
   instantly open Outlook Express with the desired identity.

Notice: From some reason, IdenSwitch bypasses the poor security system of
Outlook Express Identities. So even if your identities are protected by
password, you won't be asked for a password when you switch to them
through IdenSwitch utility.



Versions History
================


* Version 1.01: Small bug fixed.
* Version 1.00: First release.



Using IdenSwitch
================

IdenSwitch is a standalone executable, so it doesn't require any
installation process or additional DLLs. Just copy the executable
(idenswitch.exe) to any folder you like, and run it.
You can also use ZipInstaller utility to install IdenSwitch as any other
software. If you use ZipInstaller to install IdenSwitch, it'll
automatically be added to 'Add/Remove Software' list, and shortcuts to
this software will be added to your start menu and to your desktop.

The main window of IdenSwitch displays the list of all your Outlook
Express identities. You can select one identity, and then click the
'Switch To' button in order to open Outlook Express with the selected
identity.
Alternatively, you can select one or more identities, and then click the
'shortcuts' button.
In the Shortcuts window:
1. Select the folder for saving the shortcuts. (the default is your
   desktop folder)
2. Select the template string that will be used for creating the
   shortcut name. The '*' character represents the identity name. For
   example: if the template string is 'Mail For *', and the identity name
   is 'Mike', the shortcut name will be 'Mail For Mike'.
3. Click the 'Create Shortcuts' button to create the shortcuts.
Notice about the 'Set the identity to default' option: If this option is
checked, the default identity will be changed each time that you activate
the shortcut. If this option is cleared, the default identity won't be
changed, but the shortcut won't open the right identity in the first time
that you open Outlook Express after reboot.



The Default Identity
====================

When Outlook Express is opened in the first time after rebooting your
system, it always opens your default identity. You can set the default
identity by selecting it in IdenSwitch window and then clicking the
'Default' button, or in the identities manager of Outlook Express - by
selecting the desired identity under the 'User this identity...'
check-box.
By default, when you switch to another identity in IdenSwitch, it also
automatically changes the default identity to the selected identity. If
you don't want that the default identity will be changed each time that
you switch to another identity, you can avoid it by clearing the 'Set to
default on identity switch' option. However, if you do so, the 'Switch
To' operation won't work in the first time after reboot.
