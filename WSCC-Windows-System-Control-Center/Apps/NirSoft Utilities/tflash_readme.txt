Description
===========
Many Web sites today use the Macromedia Flash component for creating animated ads.
These ads consumes additional bandwidth and sometimes even slow down your computer.
Unfortunately, Internet Explorer doesn't provide a simple way to disable the Flash
component. Furthermore, if you refuse to install the Flash component, 
Internet Explorer will constantly ask you to install Flash in each time that you
enter into a Web page that contains a Flash object. 

This utility allows you to easily disable and enable the Flash component in 
Internet Explorer browser (Version 5.00 and above). When you disable flash 
with this utility, all new windows in Internet Explorer will be opened without
using the Flash component. The disabling of Flash doesn't affect the windows that
are already opened.
While the Flash Component is disabled, Internet Explorer will not ask you to 
download  and install it. However, the disabling of the Flash component might 
cause a script error in some Web pages.
Be aware that in Windows NT, 2000 and XP, this utility will not work if you 
don't have permission to write to the Registry keys of Internet Explorer.
