Description
===========

HandleCountersView is a simple tool for Windows that shows the current
number of handles (File, Directory, Token, Job, Thread, and so on...)
opened by every process running on your system and the change in number
of handles since the last time that you reset the counters.



System Requirements
===================

This tool works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows XP and
up to Windows 11. Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows are
supported. On Windows Vista and later, if you want to view the full path
of system processes , you have to run HandleCountersView as Administrator.



Versions History
================


* Version 1.19:
  o Added 'Save All Items' option (Shift+Ctrl+S).

* Version 1.18:
  o Added 'Black Background' option (Under the View menu). When it's
    turned on, the main table is displayed in black background and white
    text, instead of default system colors.
  o Fixed issue: When copying data to the clipboard or exporting to
    tab-delimited file, every line contained an empty field in the end of
    the line.
  o Added 'Full Screen' mode (View -> Full Screen or F11 key).

* Version 1.17:
  o Added 'Sort By' toolbar button.

* Version 1.16:
  o Fixed a bug that caused a small token handles leak. (It's a
    little funny and embarrassing... A tool that can be used to detect
    handles leak, actually had its own handles leak...)

* Version 1.15:
  o Updated to work properly in high DPI mode (Toolbar and properties
    window).
  o Added option to change the sorting column from the menu (View ->
    Sort By). Like the column header click sorting, if you click again
    the same sorting menu item, it'll switch between ascending and
    descending order. Also, if you hold down the shift key while choosing
    the sort menu item, you'll get a secondary sorting.

* Version 1.10:
  o Added 'Align Numeric Columns To Right' option.

* Version 1.05:
  o Added 'Put Icon On Tray' option.

* Version 1.01:
  o Added /RunAsAdmin command-line option for running
    HandleCountersView as administrator.

* Version 1.00 - First release.



Start Using HandleCountersView
==============================

This utility doesn't require any installation process or additional DLL
files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
HandleCountersView.exe
After running HandleCountersView, the main window displays the number of
handles opened by every process on your system (every type of handle is
displayed in a separated column). Also, after every refresh (F5), you can
see the change in the number of handles inside the square brackets. The
change value is relative to the time you run HandleCountersView or to the
last time that you used the 'Reset Last Counters' option (F8).

If you see a program with number of handles constantly increasing, it
means that this program probably have handle leak (handles are opened
without closing them).
