Description
===========

FolderTimeUpdate is a simple tool for Windows that scans all files and
folders under the base folder you choose, and updates the 'Modified Time'
of every folder according the latest modified time of the files stored in
it.
This tool might be useful if, for example, you backup a cluster of
folders and then restore them into another disk, but the backup program
doesn't restore the original modified time of the folders.



System Requirements
===================

This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows 2000
and up to Windows 11. Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported.



Versions History
================


* Version 1.72:
  o Fixed bug: When using the 'Exclude the following folders from
    scanning' option, the base folder was also checked with the excluded
    folders list.

* Version 1.71:
  o Updated to stop the process when you press the Esc key.

* Version 1.70:
  o Added new options: 'Exclude the following folders from scanning'
    and 'Exclude the following folders from updating'.
  o If you exclude a folder from scanning, FolderTimeUpdate will skip
    the folder completely. If you exclude a folder from updating,
    FolderTimeUpdate will scan the folder normally, but it'll not update
    the date/time values of this folder.
  o In both options, you can specify multiple folders delimited by
    comma and you can use wildcards. You can specify only the folder name
    or the full path of the folder.

* Version 1.65:
  o Added option to control how the modified time of the folder is
    updated. You can choose one of the following options: Don't update
    the modified time, Update the modified time according to the newest
    modified time (The default option), Update the modified time
    according to the newest created time, Update the modified time
    according to the oldest modified time, Update the modified time
    according to the oldest created time

    You can choose, for example, to update only the date/time of the base
    folder or to update only the date/time of subfolders at level 1 and
    2. The default range is from subfolder level 1 to infinite.
  o This option replaces the previous 'Update also the base folder'
    option.
  o Added 'Modified Difference' and 'Created Difference' columns,
    which display the time difference between the original folder time
    and the new folder time generated by the FolderTimeUpdate tool.
  o Fixed the /cfg command-line option to load the .cfg file from the
    current directory if full path is not specified.

* Version 1.55:
  o Added 'Explorer Context Menu' option. When it's turned on, you
    can right-click on a folder of Windows Explorer, choose
    'FolderTimeUpdate' from the context menu, and FolderTimeUpdate will
    be opened with this folder.

    size/position of the main window if it was not located in the primary
    monitor.

* Version 1.52:
  o Increased the size of the 'Update Mode' combo-box.

    to the .cfg file.

    time' to the 'Empty Folders' option.
  o Fixed bug: When using command-line, FolderTimeUpdate saved the
    files in ANSI encoding, but Added Byte order mark of Unicode.

* Version 1.35:
  o Updating date/time of folders from command-line: You can now
    update the date/time of folders without displaying any user
    interface, for example:
    FolderTimeUpdate.exe /BaseFolder "c:\MyFiles" /scomma
    "c:\temp\updatelog.csv"

Start Using FolderTimeUpdate
============================

FolderTimeUpdate doesn't require any installation process or additional
dll files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
FolderTimeUpdate.exe

After running FolderTimeUpdate, you can choose the desired base folder
and the other options and then click the 'Start' button to start updating
the modified time of all folders.
If you're not totally sure that the 'Modified Time' change is right for
you, you can choose the 'Simulation Mode' option. When 'Simulation Mode'
is on, FolderTimeUpdate will only display the changes of the modified
time that will be made for all folders, but without actually applying
these changes.



Command-Line Options
====================

Starting from version 1.35, you can update the date/time of folders from
command-line, without displaying any user interface. The result of the
folder date/time update will be saved into the specified log file.
For example, the following command will update the date/time of folders
according to the current settings (saved in the .cfg file), and the
result will be saved to c:\temp\log.csv:
FolderTimeUpdate.exe /scomma c:\temp\log.csv

You can use the /cfg command-line parameter to load another config file
instead of the default one:
FolderTimeUpdate.exe /cfg c:\temp\1.cfg /scomma c:\temp\log.csv

You can also override the settings saved in the .cfg file by specifying
the same variable name in the command-line... For example: Inside the
.cfg file, the base folder is stored as 'BaseFolder=folder', so you can
override this value by specifying the /BaseFolder in command-line.
In the following example, the base folder is set to c:\myfolder and the
sunfolders depth is set to 3:
FolderTimeUpdate.exe /BaseFolder "c:\myfolder" /SubfoldersDepth 3 /stab
c:\temp\log.txt

In the following example, FolderTimeUpdate is executed in simulation
mode, so the result is saved to a file, but without actually changing the
date/time of the folders:
FolderTimeUpdate.exe /Simulation 1 /stab c:\temp\log.txt



/cfg <Config File>
Start FolderTimeUpdate with the specified config file.

/stext <Filename>
Update the date/time of folders and save the log to a simple text file.

/stab <Filename>
Update the date/time of folders and save the log to a tab-delimited text
file.

/scomma <Filename>
Update the date/time of folders and save the log to a comma-delimited
text file (csv).

/stabular <Filename>
Update the date/time of folders and save the log to a tabular text file.

/shtml <Filename>
Update the date/time of folders and save the log to HTML file
(Horizontal).

/sverhtml <Filename>
Update the date/time of folders and save the log to HTML file (Vertical).

/sxml <Filename>
Update the date/time of folders and save the log to XML file.



Translating FolderTimeUpdate to other languages
===============================================

In order to translate FolderTimeUpdate to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run FolderTimeUpdate with /savelangfile parameter:
   FolderTimeUpdate.exe /savelangfile
   A file named FolderTimeUpdate_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   FolderTimeUpdate utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run FolderTimeUpdate, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run FolderTimeUpdate without the translation, simply
   rename the language file, or move it to another folder.
