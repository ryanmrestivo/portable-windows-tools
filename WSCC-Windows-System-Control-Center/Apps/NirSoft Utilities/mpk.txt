Copyright (c) 2003 - 2005 Nir Sofer



Description
===========

The MyPopupKiller utility displays the list of all opened windows of your
Web browser, and closes unwanted popup and advertising windows. In
addition, it can automatically hide the internal ads of Kazaa Media
Desktop, Download Accelerator (DAP), and Opera browser.

The MyPopupKiller utility can operate in 3 different modes:

* Manual Mode: In this mode, MyPopupKiller displays the list of opened
  windows, and allows you to easily select and close the unwanted popup
  windows. The popup and ad windows are automatically selected, so you
  can close all of them in a press of a button.
* Automatic Mode: In this mode, MyPopupKiller automatically closes
  popup and advertising windows, according to what you select in the
  configuration screen. You can temporarily enable the popups simply by
  holding Alt (the default), Ctrl, or Shift key (according to the
  configuration screen)
* Aggressive Mode: In this mode, MyPopupKiller automatically closes all
  new browser windows, even if they are not recognized as popup or ad. In
  this mode, you cannot open new browser windows, unless you hold the Alt
  key.

This utility has 2 methods to recognize unwanted ads windows:

1. It can distinguish between normal windows and popup windows. most
   popup windows contains advertising or other unwanted content. However,
   if choose to automatically close all popup windows, some "good" popup
   windows may also be closed. In such case, you can hold the Alt key in
   order to temporarily enable the popups. You can also avoid closing
   good popups by adding them to the "Allowed Windows" list. You can add
   a window by its Web address, or by the window title.
2. It can recognize an advertising window if its title or Web address
   is found in the banned windows list. If you get an advertising window
   that MyPopupKiller doesn't recognize, you can add it to the ban list,
   and avoid that ad in the future.

MyPopupKiller supports the following Web browsers:

* Internet Explorer: version 5.x and 6.x
* Netscape: version 6.x and 7.x.
* Mozilla
* MSN Explorer (version 7.x)
* Opera (partly support): version 7.x (although it not really needed
  because Opera browser has build-in support against popups)

===============================

The main screen of MyPopupKiller displays all opened windows of your
browser. You can select one or more windows (by using the check-box near
each line) and close them, or add them to the banned windows list or to
the allowed windows list. The "Type" column indicates whether
MyPopupKiller recognizes the window as popup, as advertisement window
defined in the banned windows list, or as "good" window defined in the
allowed windows list. If the hot key is enabled in the configuration
screen, you can minimize and restore the main window simply by pressing
ALT+CTRL+K or another key combination you select.



Working in manual mode
======================

In manual mode, MyPopupKiller doesn't close automatically any browser
window, but it allows you to easily kill multiple popups when you need.
When multiple popup windows appears on your screen, press the hot-key
combination (the default is Alt+Ctrl+K, you can change it to another key
combination in the configuration screen), and the main window will
appear. You can also activate the main window by double-clicking on the
tray icon. The popups and ad windows will be automatically selected. You
can select and deselect windows as you wish, and then press the 'Delete'
key in order immediately close all selected windows. If you want to add
the windows you delete to the banned windows list, press Ctrl+Delete (for
adding the windows by their title) or Shift+Delete (For adding the
windows by their Web address). After you finish to delete the windows you
want, you can close the main window and continue surfing the Web.



Working in automatic mode
=========================

In automatic mode, MyPopupKiller automatically closes popup and ad
windows, according to what you select in the configuration screen. You
can temporarily disable the automatic windows closing simply by holding
the Alt key (You can change the key to Alt or Shift in the configuration
screen)

MyPopupKiller uses the following options to determine which windows will
be closed:

* Automatically close all popup windows.
  If you select this option, all popup windows will be automatically
  closed, even if they are not recognized as advertisement. You can
  temporarily allow popup windows by holding the Ctrl/Alt/Shift key. You
  can also allow specific popups by adding them to the Allowed Windows
  List. In order to easily add the Web address of a window to the Allowed
  Windows List, select the window in the main screen and press Ctrl+L.
* Automatically close all advertising windows, according to the banned
  windows list.
  If you select this option, MyPopupKiller will automatically close only
  the popup windows that their title or address exists in the banned
  windows list. If you get an ad window that MyPopupKiller doesn't
  recognize, you can add it to the banned windows list, so in the next
  time MyPopupKiller will recognize it and close it immediately.
* Close advertising windows even if they appear in regular window.
  (This options is available only if you select the previous one) If you
  select this option, MyPopupKiller will close all windows that their
  title exists in the banned windows list, even if they are appear in
  regular window. (not popup window)



Working in aggressive mode
==========================

in aggressive mode, all new browser windows are immediately closed by
MyPopupKiller, even if they are not recognized as ad or popup. You cannot
open new browser windows in this mode, unless you hold the Alt key.



The banned windows list
=======================

The banned windows list contains window titles and Web addresses of known
advertising windows. MyPopupKiller uses this list to recognize
advertising windows. When you see an advertisement that MyPopupKiller
cannot recognize, you can easily add by selecting the problematic window
and pressing Ctrl+Del (For adding the window title) or Shift+Del (For
adding the Web address). You can also edit the list in the "Banned
Windows List" dialog-box.

For each item, you should select the appropriate "match mode":

* Window Title: Whole text - MyPopupKiller will recognize a window as
  ad only if its title matches completely to the title in the ban list.
* Window Title: Start of text - MyPopupKiller will recognize a window
  as ad if its title string starts with the text you write in the ban
  list. For example: If you add to the ban list the string "Special
  Offer!", all the windows that their title starts with "Special Offer!"
  will be recognized as advertising windows.
* Window Title: Any part of text - MyPopupKiller will recognize a
  window as ad if its title string contains the text you write in the ban
  list.
* Web Address: Start of address - MyPopupKiller will recognize a window
  as ad if its Web address (http://) corresponds to the address you write
  in the ban list.

The banned windows list is saved in a simple text file, so you can edit
it in simple text editor, like Notepad. This file - ban.txt is located in
the same folder of the executable.

Be aware that the first character of each line represents the match mode:
$ for "Whole Text"
@ for "Start of text"
! for "Any part of text"
# for "Web Address"



The allowed windows list
========================

The windows that you add to this list won't be closed by MyPopupKiller,
even if they are recognized as popup or advertising windows. As in the
banned windows list, you can add a window by its window title or by its
Web address (http://...).

The allowed windows list is saved in a simple text file, so you can edit
it in simple text editor, like Notepad. This file - allow.txt is located
in the same folder of the executable. As in the banned windows list, the
first character of each line represents the match mode.

Notice: This feature currently works properly only for Internet Explorer.



Hiding the ads of other applications
====================================

This utility allows you to automatically hide the internal ads of the
following adware applications:
* Kazaa Media Desktop (versions 1.x, 2.x)
* Download Accelerator (version 5.x and 7.x)
* Opera browser (version 7.x)
You can activate this feature from the configuration screen (there is one
check-box for each application). Be aware that this feature is not
affected by the closing mode, and the ads will be hidden even if you are
in manual mode.



Messenger Service popups
========================

The "Messenger Service" is a standard service in Windows NT, Windows 2000
and Windows XP that allows to administrators to send messages to users on
a network. Unfortunately, some users and companies exploit this system
service for sending annoying ads popups to innocent users.
If sometimes you receive popup windows with "Messenger Service" title,
you can stop these unwanted popups by disabling the Messenger Service in
your machine. It's possible to disable the "Messenger Service" directly
from the "Services" module of your operating system. However, if you
don't know how to disable a service in your operating system, you can
simply disable it from this utility: From the 'Options' menu, select
"Messenger Service Popups", and click the "Disable Messenger Service"
button.



Disbale and enable the Macromedia Flash Player
==============================================

Many Web sites today use the Macromedia Flash component for creating
animated ads. These ads consumes additional bandwidth and sometimes even
slow down your computer. Unfortunately, Internet Explorer and other Web
browsers don't provide a simple way to disable and enable the Flash
component.
This utility allows you to disable and enable the Flash component in the
following browsers:
* Internet Explorer (Version 5.x, and 6.x)
* Netscape browser (Version 6.x and 7.x)
* Mozilla browser
* Opera browser (Version 7.x)
You can enable/disable the Flash component for a single browser, or
enable/disable it in all browsers at once.
However, there are some limitations that you should be aware of:

* In Internet Explorer: When you enable/disable the Flash component,
  the current opened windows are not affected by the change. you have to
  open a new browser window in order to see the effect of
  enabling/disabling the Flash component. Also, be aware that when you
  disable/enable Flash in Internet Explorer, other "IE based" browsers,
  like MyIE and MSN Explorer are also affected by this change.
* In Netscape/Mozilla browsers: under Windows 98 and Windows ME, you
  have to close all browser windows before enabling/disabling the Flash
  component. Also, if more than one version of the browser is installed
  on your computer, only the latest installed version of the browser will
  be affected.
* In Opera browser: You have to completely close the Opera browser and
  then open it again in order to see the effect of enabling/disabling the
  Flash component.
