Description
===========

NetConnectChoose is a simple tool that allows you to easily choose the
default Internet connection that will be used by all Internet
applications, when you have more than a single Internet connection on the
same time. (Each connection on different network adapter)
It also displays extensive information about every active
network/Internet connection, including network adapter name, MAC Address,
Name Servers, MTU, Interface Speed, current incoming/outgoing data speed,
number of received/sent packets, received/sent bytes, and more...



System Requirements
===================


* This utility works on any version of Windows operating system,
  starting from Windows 2000 and up to Windows 11. Both 32-bit and 64-bit
  systems are supported.
* On Windows Vista/7/8 with UAC turned on, you have to run
  NetConnectChoose as admin in order to smoothly change the default
  Internet connection. If you don't execute NetConnectChoose as admin,
  you'll get a confirmation UAC message-box for every default connection
  change.

  o Fixed bug: In some network configurations, NetConnectChoose
    failed to set the default Internet connection.

    monitor.

* Version 1.06
  o Fixed to work again on Windows 2000.

* Version 1.05

    maximum received speed.

* Version 1.01 - Added option to choose another font to display the
  network adapters information on the main window.

Known Issues
============


* On Windows XP, when changing the default Internet connection, all
  existing TCP connections stop working. On Windows Vista/7/8, when
  switching to another default Internet connection, the existing TCP
  connections remain active. This means that on Windows Vista/7/8, you
  can start downloading from one Internet connection and then switch to
  the second Internet connection, and start another download on the
  second Internet connection without interrupting the first download
  process, but it's impossible to do that on Windows XP.



Start Using NetConnectChoose
============================

NetConnectChoose doesn't require any installation process or additional
dll files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
NetConnectChoose.exe
After running it, the main window displays the details of all active
network/internet connections. In order to change the default Internet
connection, you can select the desired connection and press F8 (Set As
Default Connection) or you can simply press F9 to switch between the
active connections.



Packets Information
===================

NetConnectChoose displays packets information for every active network
connection on your system. The packets information include the total
number of received bytes, total number of sent bytes, total number of
received packets, total number of sent packets, current sent data speed,
and current received data speed.
The packet counters are saved to the .cfg file, so in the next time that
you run NetConnectChoose, it'll start with the number you had when you
closed NetConnectChoose previously. You can reset the packets information
to 0, by using the 'Reset Packet Counters' option.



Command-Line Options
====================



/SetDefault <MAC Address>
Set the specified network adapter as the default Internet connection. On
Windows Vista/7/8 with UAC turned on, you must execute this command with
'Run As Administrator'.
Example:
NetConnectChoose.exe /SetDefault 00-21-AD-C2-36-A0

/SwitchDefault
Set the next network adapter as the default Internet connection. You can
use this command to easily switch between 2 or more Internet connection.
On Windows Vista/7/8 with UAC turned on, you must execute this command
with 'Run As Administrator'.



Translating NetConnectChoose to other languages
===============================================

In order to translate NetConnectChoose to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run NetConnectChoose with /savelangfile parameter:
   NetConnectChoose.exe /savelangfile
   A file named NetConnectChoose_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   NetConnectChoose utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run NetConnectChoose, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run NetConnectChoose without the translation, simply
   rename the language file, or move it to another folder.
