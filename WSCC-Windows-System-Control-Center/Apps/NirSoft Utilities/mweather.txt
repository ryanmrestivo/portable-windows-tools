Description
===========

The MetarWeather utility decodes METAR weather reports from around the
world, and displays them in a simple weather report table. You can save
the weather report into text, HTML or XML files. MetarWeather can decode
METAR reports from a text file, or download the latest reports directly
from the Internet.

About METAR Reports
===================

METAR ("Aviation Routine Weather Report") is an international standard
for reporting the weather conditions in thousands of airports about the
world. The METAR weather reports are usually issued once per hour, but
when there are significant changes in weather, the METAR reports are
issued more frequently.
Each METAR report contains essential information about the current
weather conditions: Temperature, Dew Point, Barometric Pressure, Wind
Speed and Direction, Visibility, Clouds Cover, Current Weather (Rain,
Thunderstorms, Hail, Snow and so on...), and more...
Here's an example for a single METAR report:
KMCO 290853Z 10006KT 8SM TSRA FEW029CB BKN110 OVC300 22/21 A3012 RMK AO2 TSB30 
SLP198 P0005 60017 T02170211 58003
For most people, this line looks like an unmeaningful characters
sequence, but actually it contains a lots of information about the
weather conditions. If you feed the above METAR line into the
MetarWeather utility, you'll see the details of the weather information
that this METAR represents. Click Here to watch this METAR weather report
after decoding it with MetarWeather.



Getting METAR Reports From The Internet
=======================================

The following Web sites provides free access to METAR data.
* METAR Data Access - at NOAA Web site
* Aviation Digital Data Service
* Surface Observations - at weather.uwyo.edu
* Texas A&amp;M Weather Page
* Aviation Weather Brief
You can use the above sites to obtain METAR lines and decode them with
MetarWeather utility. However, you can also view the latest weather
reports without using the above Web sites, because the MetarWeather
utility automatically obtains the METAR data from NOAA web site and
immediately displays the decoded weather information in a table.



Using MetarWeather
==================

This utility is a standalone executable. You don't have to install
anything, just run the executable file (mweather.exe) and start using it.

After your run it, you have 3 options to view the latest METAR reports:
* Load METARs From The Net: In this option, you can view the latest
  METAR reports of the stations that you select. The METAR lines are
  automatically obtained from the Internet and decoded to a readable
  format.
  You can find the station you need by selecting the desired country, or
  by typing the station name in the top text-box. In order to select a
  station, click the check-box beside the station information.

  Currently, There are 3 different sources to download the latest METAR
  reports:
  o NOAA: METAR Data Access Web Site - This is the default download
    source, and also the most effective. MetarWeather submits all
    selected stations, in one request, to the METAR Data Access Web Site,
    and extracts the METAR reports from the returned Web page.
  o NOAA: METAR Text Files - If you select this data source, a single
    HTTP request is sent to NOAA server for each METAR station that you
    select. This download source is quite ineffective, especially if you
    want to download METAR reports from multiple stations. It's provided
    only as a backup to the first NOAA download source.
  o University of Wyoming: Last 24-Hour METAR Reports - As opposed to
    the previous 2 download sources, This download source retrieves all
    METAR weather reports from the last 24 hours, not only the latest
    available METAR report.

  Notice: The stations list in this utility is based on the stations list
  maintained by Greg Thompson. It contains the most active METAR
  stations, but not all of them. If you know about an active METAR
  station that doesn't appear in the list, you can still view its weather
  report by typing the ICAO code of the station. After you select all the
  station you need, click the "Get METAR Reports" button, and wait a few
  seconds to download the METAR reports of the selected stations.
* Load METARs From File: If you have a text file that contains raw
  METAR reports, you can select this file, and view the weather reports
  in readable format.
  You can also use this option to view the current weather conditions in
  all over the world:
  1. Download the latest cycle file from
     http://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/observations/metar/cycles/ This file
     contains the latest METARs of all stations around the world.
  2. Select the downloaded file, and wait a few seconds until all
     METAR reports are loaded. Be aware that these cycle files contains
     thousands of reports, and when you load them, they consume a fair
     amount of memory and system resources.


* Type METAR Lines: This option simply allows you to type raw METAR
  lines into a text box (or paste them from the clipboard), and view the
  these METAR reports in readable format.
You can use this option to get a nice report of particular weather event:
1. Go to one of the Web sites that provides METAR reports, and obtain
   a sequence of METAR reports of the desired station.
2. Copy the METAR sequence from the Web site, and paste it to the
   text-box of MetarWeather.
