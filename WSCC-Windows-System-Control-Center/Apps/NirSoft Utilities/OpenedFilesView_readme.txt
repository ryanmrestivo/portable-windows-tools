Description
===========

OpenedFilesView displays the list of all opened files on your system. For
each opened file, additional information is displayed: handle value,
read/write/delete access, file position, the process that opened the
file, and more...
Optionally, you can also close one or more opened files, or close the
process that opened these files.

This utility is especially useful if you try to delete/move/open a file
and you get one of the following error messages:
* Cannot delete [filename]: There has been a sharing violation. The
  source or destination file may be in use.
* Cannot delete [filename]: It is being used by another person or
  program. Close any programs that might be using the file and try again.
When you get one of these error messages, OpenedFilesView will show you
which process lock your file. Closing the right process will solve this
problem. optionally, you can also release the file by closing the handle
from OpenedFilesView utility. However, be aware that after closing a file
in this way, the program that opened the file may become unstable, and
even crash.



System Requirements
===================

This utility works properly on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows
2003/2008, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, Windows 11.
On 64-bit systems, you have to use the 64-bit version of OpenedFilesView.
This tool may not work on systems with the new driver signing policy
(Windows 10/11 with 'Secure Boot' turned on). Also, you must have
administrative privilege in order to run this utility.



Known Issue
===========

If you try to run the 64-bit verion of this tool directly from a zip
file, you may get the following error message:
The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b). Click OK to
close the application.

In order to solve this issue, you have to manually extract the content of
the zip file into a folder, and then run it from there.



Versions History
================


* Version 1.91:
  o Updated to work properly in high DPI mode.
  o Added 'Black Background' option (Under the View menu). When it's
    turned on, the main table is displayed in black background and white
    text, instead of default system colors.

* Version 1.90:
  o Fixed the /filefilter and /wildcardfilter command-line options to
    work properly with long filenames when the 'Convert To Long Path
    Names' option is turned on.
  o Fixed security issue: The driver of OpenedFilesView allowed
    access for non-admin users.
  o Be aware: Because the updated driver is signed with a newer code
    signing certificate, OpenedFilesView stopped working on Windows Vista
    64-bit, and maybe on other systems too.
  o If this version doesn't work on your system, you can download the
    version 1.87 of OpenedFilesView: 32-bit, 64-bit.

* Version 1.87:
  o Added OpenedFilesView icon to the Explorer context menu.
  o Fixed a bug that caused a small token handles leak.

* Version 1.86:
  o Fixed OpenedFilesView to send the data to stdout when specifying
    an empty string (e.g: OpenedFilesView.exe /scomma "" ).

* Version 1.85:
  o Added new option: 'Copy Locked Files To Another Folder' (F7),
    which allows you to copy locked files that cannot be copied with
    Windows Explorer. Be aware that this feature doesn't work if the file
    is opened by 'System Process'.

* Version 1.81:
  o Added 'Align Numeric Columns To Right' option.

* Version 1.80:
  o OpenedFilesView is now a Unicode application so it can display
    and save filenames with any character (Until now non-ANSI characters
    were displayed as '?').
  o You can now choose the desired encoding (ANSI, UTF-8, UTF-16) to
    save the csv/xml/text/html files (Options -> Save File Encoding)
  o Added 'Quick Filter' feature (View -> Use Quick Filter or
    Ctrl+Q). When it's turned on, you can type a string in the text-box
    added under the toolbar and OpenedFilesView will instantly filter the
    files list, showing only items that contain the string you typed.

* Version 1.70:
  o Added 'Close Processes Of Selected Files'. As opposed to the
    'Kill Processes Of Selected Files' option that brutally kills the
    process, this option sends a request to the application to close
    itself as soon as possible (using WM_QUERYENDSESSION and
    WM_ENDSESSION Windows messages).
  o Added closeprocess and killprocess commands to the /closefile and
    /closefolder command-line options, which allow you to close/kill the
    process instead of closing the file handle, for example:
    OpenedFilesView.exe /closefile closeprocess "c:\myfile.txt"
  o Added 'Elevated Process' column.
  o Added new information to 'Attributes' column: 'T' for 'Temporary
    File', 'I' for 'Not Content Indexed', 'E' for encrypted file, 'X' for
    'No Scrub File', and 'V' for 'Integrity Attribute'.

* Version 1.65:
  o Added 'Process User' column.
  o Added 'Save All Items' option.

* Version 1.61:
  o Explorer context menu inside OpenedFilesView: When you
    right-click on a single item while holding down the shift key,
    OpenedFilesView now displays the context menu of Windows Explorer,
    instead of the OpenedFilesView context menu.

* Version 1.60:
  o Fixed bug: OpenedFilesView failed to remember the last
    size/position of the main window if it was not located in the primary
    monitor.
  o Finally, fixed the error 100005 problem occurs in some systems.

* Version 1.58:
  o Added a small fix that hopefully will solve the error 100005
    problem occurs in some systems.

* Version 1.57:
  o Added secondary sorting support: You can now get a secondary
    sorting, by holding down the shift key while clicking the column
    header. Be aware that you only have to hold down the shift key when
    clicking the second/third/fourth column. To sort the first column you
    should not hold down the Shift key.
  o Fixed to display local date/time values according to daylight
    saving time settings.

* Version 1.56:
  o Added /wildcardfilter command-line option, for example:
    OpenedFilesView.exe /wildcardfilter *.dat

* Version 1.55:
  o The 64-bit version of OpenedFilesView is now provided with a
    signed driver, so there is no need for driver signing test mode
    anymore..
    (I randomly found out that the digital signature I purchased 1.5
    years ago to sign the .exe files of NirSoft is now also suitable for
    signing drivers !)

  o Fixed bug: OpenedFilesView failed to close network files from
    command-line.

* Version 1.47:
  o Added 'Add Header Line To CSV/Tab-Delimited File' option. When
    this option is turned on, the column names are added as the first
    line when you export to csv or tab-delimited file.

* Version 1.46:
  o /filefilter now allows you to specify a filename without a path.
    For example, if you run OpenedFilesView with '/filefilter index.dat',
    all opened index.dat filenames will be displayed.

Known Issues
============


* OpenedFilesView cannot close files opened by Windows kernel.



How does it work ?
==================

OpenedFilesView uses the NtQuerySystemInformation API to enumerate all
handles in the system. After filtering non-file handles, it uses a
temporary device driver - NirSoftOpenedFilesDriver.sys for reading the
information about each handle from the kernel memory. This device driver
is automatically unloaded from the system when you exit from
OpenedFilesView utility.



Using OpenedFilesView
=====================

OpenedFilesView doesn't require any installation process or additional
DLLs. In order to start using it, just run the executable file -
OpenedFilesView.exe
The main window of OpenedFilesView display the list of all files
currently opened in your system. In order to refresh the list of opened
files, press F5, or alternatively, use the Auto Refresh feature (Options
-> Auto Refresh -> Every x seconds) in order to automatically refresh the
opened files list every 1 - 5 seconds.



Explorer Context Menu
=====================

Starting from version 1.10, you can launch OpenedFilesView directly from
Windows Explorer, and view only the handles of the file or folder that
you want to inspect.
In order to enable this feature, check the 'Enable Explorer Context Menu'
under the Options menu. After you enable this feature, you can
right-click on any file or folder on Windows Explorer, and choose the
'OpenedFilesView' item from the menu.
If you run the OpenedFilesView option for a folder, it'll display all
opened files inside that folder.
If you run the OpenedFilesView option for a file, it'll display all
opened handles for that file.



Other Options
=============


* Show Opened Directories: By default, OpenedFilesView only display the
  opened files. If you also want to view the opened Directories
  (folders), select this option.
* Show Network Files: By default, OpenedFilesView only display the
  opened files on your local drives. If you also want to view the opened
  files on remote network drives, select this option.
* Sort On Refresh: If this option is selected, new opened files (after
  refresh) are added to the right position according to the current
  column sort. If this option is not selected, new opened files are added
  to the end of the opened files list.



Watch specific application with Drag & Drop
===========================================

If you want to view only the opened files of specific application instead
of the entire system, you can drag the target icon of the toolbar into
the window of the desired application. Whenever you want to view all
opened files again, simply use the 'Clear File/Process Filters' option.

The <column> parameter can specify the column index (0 for the first
column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the name of the column,
like "Filename" and "Created Time". You can specify the '~' prefix
character (e.g: "~Created Time") if you want to sort in descending order.
You can put multiple /sort in the command-line if you want to sort by
multiple columns.

Firefox\firefox.exe"
OpenedFilesView.exe /processfilter myapp.exe



Translating OpenedFilesView To Another Language
===============================================

OpenedFilesView allows you to easily translate all menus, dialog-boxes,
and other strings to other languages.
In order to do that, follow the instructions below:
1. Run OpenedFilesView with /savelangfile parameter:
