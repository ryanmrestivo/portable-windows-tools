System Requirements
===================


* This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows
  2000 and up to Windows 11, and with any version of Google Chrome.



System Requirements
===================


* Version 1.80:
  o Added support for decrypting cookies encrypted with app-bound
    encryption on new versions of Chrome. This feature only works when
    you run ChromeCookiesView as Administrator.
  o Added 'System Protect Folder' and 'Registry Hives Folder' fields
    to the external drive feature. You must fill these fields if the
    cookies are encrypted with the new app-bound encryption.
  o Added 'Encryption Type' column. (for app-bound encryption, this
    column displays 'v20', for previous encryption method, this column
    displays 'v10' )
  o Added 'Run As Administrator' option (Ctrl+F11) under the help
    menu.
  o Added /RunAsAdmin command-line option for running
    ChromeCookiesView as administrator.

* Version 1.76:
  o Added 'Sort By' toolbar button.

* Version 1.75:
  o When the cookies file is locked by Chrome Web browser,
    ChromeCookiesView now displays an error message.

    Windows 11 22H2.

  o Updated to keep the scroll position after you delete cookies.
  o Added 'Brave Cookies File' button to the 'Advanced Options'
    window.

    the last used profile, when there are multiple profiles.

* Version 1.68:
  o Updated to work properly with the new cookies file location
    (Under the Network subfolder).
  o Fixed the external drive feature to work properly if you sign in
    with Microsoft account.
  o Be aware that in order to decrypt the cookies created while you
    signed in with Microsoft account, you have to provide the random
    DPAPI password generated for your Microsoft account instead of the
    actual login password. You can find this DPAPI password with the
    MadPassExt tool.

* Version 1.67:
  o Added 'Copy Clicked Cell' option to the right-click context menu,
    which copies to the clipboard the text of cell that you right-clicked
    with the mouse.

  o Added option to change the sorting column from the menu (View ->
    Sort By). Like the column header click sorting, if you click again
    the same sorting menu item, it'll switch between ascending and
    descending order. Also, if you hold down the shift key while choosing
    the sort menu item, you'll get a secondary sorting.

    can turn off this option if you want to get the original name/value
    without escape sequence decoding.

    Chrome/Chromium version 80 or later (They changed the encryption
    algorithm).
  o Be aware that the 'Local State' file ( located inside the 'User
    Data' folder) contains the encryption key needed to decrypt the
    cookies of Chromium 80.
  o In most cases, ChromeCookiesView will find your 'Local State'
    file automatically, but if it fails to find this file from some
    reason, you can manually type the 'Local State' filename in the
    'Advanced Options' window.

* Version 1.58:
  o Added 'Edge Cookies File' button to the 'Advanced Options'
    window, which automatically fills the cookies file of the new

Using ChromeCookiesView
=======================

ChromeCookiesView doesn't require any installation process or additional
DLL files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
ChromeCookiesView.exe
The main window of ChromeCookiesView displays the list of all cookies
stored in your Google Chrome Web browser. You can select one or more
chookie entries, and then use the 'Delete Selected Cookies' (Ctrl+Del) to
delete them.
If you want to view the cookies stored in another cookies file, go to
'Advanced Options' window (F9) and choose the desired cookies file.



Command-Line Options
====================



/RunAsAdmin
Runs ChromeCookiesView as administrator.

/DeleteCookies <Host> {Cookie Name}
Deletes cookies from command-line. If you specify only the host name, all
cookies of this host name will be deleted. If you also specify the cookie
name, only this specific cookie will be deleted.

Examples:
ChromeCookiesView.exe /DeleteCookies ".amazon.com"
ChromeCookiesView.exe /DeleteCookies ".amazon.com" "session-token"

/DeleteCookiesWildcard <Host Wildcard> {Cookie Name Wildcard}
Similar to /DeleteCookies, but it also allows you to specify the host
name and cookie name as wildcard. For example, if you specify
"*.google.com", all google.com cookies will be deleted (including
www.google.com, accounts.google.com, and so on)

Examples:
ChromeCookiesView.exe /DeleteCookiesWildcard "*.google.com"
ChromeCookiesView.exe /DeleteCookiesWildcard "*.amazon.*" "session*"

/CookiesFile <Filename>
Specifies the cookies file to load from command-line, for example:
ChromeCookiesView.exe /CookiesFile "c:\temp\Chrome\cookies"

/stext <Filename>
Save the cookies list into a regular text file.

/stab <Filename>

/scomma <Filename>

/stabular <Filename>

/sort <column>
This command-line option can be used with other save options for sorting
by the desired column. If you don't specify this option, the list is
sorted according to the last sort that you made from the user interface.
The <column> parameter can specify the column index (0 for the first
column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the name of the column,
like "Host Name" and "Path". You can specify the '~' prefix character
(e.g: "~Secure") if you want to sort in descending order. You can put
multiple /sort in the command-line if you want to sort by multiple
columns.

Examples:
ChromeCookiesView.exe /shtml "f:\temp\cookies.html" /sort 2 /sort ~1
ChromeCookiesView.exe /shtml "f:\temp\cookies.html" /sort "Host Name"
/sort "Path"

/nosort
When you specify this command-line option, the list will be saved without
any sorting.



Translating ChromeCookiesView to other languages
================================================

In order to translate ChromeCookiesView to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run ChromeCookiesView with /savelangfile parameter:
   ChromeCookiesView.exe /savelangfile
   A file named ChromeCookiesView_lng.ini will be created in the folder
   of ChromeCookiesView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.

   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
