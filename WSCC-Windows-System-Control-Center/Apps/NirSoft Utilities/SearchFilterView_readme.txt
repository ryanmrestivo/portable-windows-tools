Description
===========

When you search the content of files with Windows search, it uses the
right search IFilter plugin according to the file extension. This utility
allows you to easily view the search filters installed on your system and
the file extensions that are associated with them, as well as it allows
you to easily add or remove file extensions for these filters.



System Requirements
===================

This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows 2000
and up to Windows 7. Both 32-bit and x64 systems are supported.



Using SearchFilterView
======================

SearchFilterView doesn't require any installation process or additional
dll files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
SearchFilterView.exe

The main window of SearchFilterView contains 2 panes: the upper pane
displays the list of all installed filters. When selecting a filter in
the upper pane, the lower pane displays the list of all extensions
associated with the selected filter in the upper pane.
When selecting a filter, you can select one or more extensions in the
lower pane and then press F8 (Remove Selected Extensions From Filter) to
remove the selected extensions. You can also press F7 (Add Extensions To
Filter) and then type the list of extensions that you want to add to the
selected filters.

Notice: When you add/remove extensions for a filter, the changes only
take effect after you log off and then log on.



Translating SearchFilterView to other languages
===============================================

In order to translate SearchFilterView to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run SearchFilterView with /savelangfile parameter:
   SearchFilterView.exe /savelangfile
   A file named SearchFilterView_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   SearchFilterView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run SearchFilterView, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run SearchFilterView without the translation, simply
   rename the language file, or move it to another folder.
