Description
===========

LiveTcpUdpWatch is a tool for Windows that displays live information
about all TCP and UDP activity on your system. Every line in the main
table of LiveTcpUdpWatch displays the protocol (TCP/UDP/IPv4/IPv6),
local/remote IP address, local/remote port, number of sent/received
bytes, number of sent/received packets, connect/disconnect time (For TCP
only), and the process (ID and path) responsible for this activity.



LiveTcpUdpWatch vs CurrPorts vs NetworkTrafficView
==================================================

This tool may look very similar to other tools of NirSoft - CurrPorts and
NetworkTrafficView, but every tool behave differently and uses different
technique to extract the network information.
* CurrPorts displays the current table of active TCP connections and
  TCP/UDP listening ports. but this technique has some disadvantages, for
  example, if UDP packets are sent from your computer to remote network
  address, you won't see it with CurrPorts, because with UDP there is no
  really a connection and the UDP table contains only listening UDP
  ports. The advantage of CurrPorts is the ability to use it without
  elevation (Run As Administrator).
* NetworkTrafficView uses network sniffing technique - It analyzes
  every packet sent/received by your network card and displays extensive
  summary according to the display mode you choose. The disadvantages of
  this tool: You have to choose a network card and capture method for
  activating the network sniffer.
* LiveTcpUdpWatch uses event tracing API to get live information from
  Windows Kernel about every TCP/UDP packet sent/received on your system.
  As opposed to CurrPorts, it captures all UDP activity with process
  information, but without the need of using a network sniffer.



System Requirements
===================

This tool works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows XP and
up to Windows 11. Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows are
supported. On Windows Vista and later this tool requires to run as
Administrator (elevation).



Versions History

Start Using LiveTcpUdpWatch
===========================

LiveTcpUdpWatch doesn't require any installation process or additional
DLL files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
LiveTcpUdpWatch.exe

After running LiveTcpUdpWatch, it immediately starts display any TCP/UDP
activity on your system. You can choose from the Options menu which
protocols you want to capture (TCP, UDP, IPv4, IPv6). You can also press
Ctrl+X (Clear All) to clear all accumulated data and start again with
empty table. If you want to temporary stop the network tracing , simply
uncheck the 'Capture Network Data' option or press F2.

If you want to see only the active TCP connections, simply turn on the
'Remove Closed TCP Connections' option (Under the Options menu).



Merge if only local port is different
=====================================

If you want to decrease the number of lines displayed by LiveTcpUdpWatch,
you can activate the following options: 'Merge TCP if only local port is
different', 'Merge UDP if only local port is different' (Under the
Options menu).
For example: If your Web browser creates 5 TCP connections to the same IP
address and the same port (80 or 443) - instead of 5 lines, you'll get
the summary of all 5 connections in one line and the 'Connections Count'
column will display '5'.

For UDP, it's even more significant, because every DNS query is sent to
the same remote address and port (53), but different local port, so
activating the 'Merge UDP' option will put all DNS activity in one line
instead of many lines.



IP Address Country/City/ASN Information
=======================================

Starting from version 1.50, you can use the IP-Location files from
https://github.com/sapics/ip-location-db for viewing country/city/ASN
information of remote IP addresses.
You can use all 3 types of CSV files: Country, City, and ASN. Both IPv4
and IPv6 files are supported. In order to use these IP-Location files,
simply download the desired files and put them in the same folder of
LiveTcpUdpWatch.exe with their original filename (For example:
asn-country-ipv4.csv , asn-ipv4.csv, asn-ipv6.csv)



Integration with IPNetInfo utility
==================================

If you want to get more information about the remote IP address displayed
in LiveTcpUdpWatch utility, you can use the integration with IPNetInfo
utility in order to easily view the IP address information loaded
directly from WHOIS servers:
1. Download and run the latest version of IPNetInfo utility and put
   ipnetinfo.exe in the same folder of LiveTcpUdpWatch.exe .
2. Select the desired items, and then choose "Check Remote Address
   With IPNetInfo" from the File menu or from the right-click context
   menu.
3. IPNetInfo will retrieve the information about remote IP addresses
   of the selected items.



Command-Line Options
====================



/CaptureTime <Milliseconds>
Specifies the capture time in milliseconds for the save command-line
options (/stext, /stab, /scomma, and so on...)
The default is 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds).

For example, if you want to capture the TCP/UDP activity for 20 seconds
and then save the result to csv file:
LiveTcpUdpWatch.exe /CaptureTime 20000 /scomma "c:\temp\tcpudp.csv"

/cfg <Filename>
Start LiveTcpUdpWatch with the specified configuration file. For example:
LiveTcpUdpWatch.exe /cfg "c:\config\ltuw.cfg"
LiveTcpUdpWatch.exe /cfg "%AppData%\LiveTcpUdpWatch.cfg"

/stext <Filename>
Save the report of LiveTcpUdpWatch into a simple text file.

/stab <Filename>
Save the report of LiveTcpUdpWatch into a tab-delimited text file.

/scomma <Filename>
Save the report of LiveTcpUdpWatch into a comma-delimited text file (csv).

/shtml <Filename>
Save the report of LiveTcpUdpWatch into HTML file (Horizontal).

/sverhtml <Filename>
Save the report of LiveTcpUdpWatch into HTML file (Vertical).

/sxml <Filename>
Save the report of LiveTcpUdpWatch into XML file.

/sjson <Filename>
Save the report of LiveTcpUdpWatch into JSON file.

/sort <column>
This command-line option can be used with other save options for sorting
by the desired column. The <column> parameter can specify the column
index (0 for the first column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the
name of the column, like "Local Address" and "Remote Address". You can
specify the '~' prefix character (e.g: "~Received Bytes") if you want to
sort in descending order. You can put multiple /sort in the command-line
if you want to sort by multiple columns.



/Columns <Comma Delimited Columns List>
Allows you to set the columns to display or the columns to export from
command-line. You have to specify the column names, delimited by comma,
for example:
LiveTcpUdpWatch.exe /scomma c:\temp\tcp-udp-list.csv /Columns "Process
Name,Process ID,Protocol,Remote Port,Remote Address,Received Bytes,Sent
Bytes"

You can also specify the column names without space characters, for
example:
LiveTcpUdpWatch.exe /Columns
""ProcessName,ProcessID,Protocol,RemotePort,RemoteAddress,ReceivedBytes,Sen
tBytes"



Custom Context Menu
===================

Starting from version 1.55, you can add your own custom menu items into
the upper pane context menu of LiveTcpUdpWatch.
In order to do this, you have to exit completely from LiveTcpUdpWatch and
then edit the LiveTcpUdpWatch.cfg file, located in the same folder of
LiveTcpUdpWatch.exe. You can edit LiveTcpUdpWatch.cfg with notepad or any
other text editor.

The structure of the custom menu configuration is very simple, and looks
like this:


[CustomMenu]
Caption0=Menu Caption
Command0=Menu Command
Caption1=Menu Caption
Command1=Menu Command
Caption2=Menu Caption
Command2=Menu Command
.
.
.



You can create up to 10 different menu items (from 0 to 9). The command
string is an executable file with parameters that provide the information
about the selected items.
For example, the following menu item will ping the remote IP address of
the selected item in a command-prompt window:


[CustomMenu]
Caption0=Ping This IP address
Command0=cmd.exe /K ping %RemoteIP%


LiveTcpUdpWatch will replace the %RemoteIP%variable with the remote IP
address of the selected item. You can use the following variables for the
custom menu command (They are identical to the column names, but without
the space characters): %ProcessID% %ProcessName% %Protocol% %LocalPort%
%LocalAddress% %RemotePort% %RemotePortName% %RemoteAddress%
%ReceivedBytes% %SentBytes% %ReceivedPackets% %SentPackets%
%ReceiveSpeed% %SendSpeed% %ConnectTime% %DisconnectTime% %AcceptTime%
%ConnectionsCount% %DisconnectCount% %ProcessPath% %RemoteIPCountry%
%ASN% %Organization% %RemoteIP% %RemoteHostName%

Finally, here's an example for full custom menu items. Notice that
Caption2 and Caption5 are actually a menu separator.

[CustomMenu]
Caption0=Ping Remote IP Address
Command0=cmd.exe /K ping %RemoteIP%
Caption1=Ping Remote Host Name
Command1=cmd.exe /K ping %RemoteHostName%
Caption2=-
Caption3=Open IP Address In Chrome
Command3=chrome.exe %RemoteIP%
Caption4=Open IP Address In Firefox
Command4=Firefox.exe %RemoteIP%
Caption5=-
Caption6=Google Search Remote IP
Command6=Firefox.exe https://www.google.com/search?q=%RemoteIP%


The custom menu of the above example looks like this:




Translating LiveTcpUdpWatch to other languages
==============================================

In order to translate LiveTcpUdpWatch to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run LiveTcpUdpWatch with /savelangfile parameter:
   LiveTcpUdpWatch.exe /savelangfile
   A file named LiveTcpUdpWatch_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   LiveTcpUdpWatch utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run LiveTcpUdpWatch, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run LiveTcpUdpWatch without the translation, simply
   rename the language file, or move it to another folder.
