Description
===========

MZCookiesView is an alternative to the standard 'Cookie Manager' provided
by Firefox and Mozilla browsers. It displays the details of all cookies
stored inside the cookies file (cookies.txt or cookies.sqlite) in one
table, and allows you to save the cookies list into text, HTML or XML
file, delete unwanted cookies, and backup/restore the cookies file.



Notice:
=======

The name of this tool was changed from MozillaCookiesView to
MZCookiesView due to the obsession of Mozilla Foundation people with
their registered trademark. I have received a threatening letter from the
attorney of Mozilla Foundation saying that using the 'Mozilla' word
inside the name of my software infringes their trademark rights and
demanding that I'll change the name of this tool.
In order to avoid from any trouble in the future, I decided to change the
name of this tool to MZCookiesView.



System Requirement
==================

MZCookiesView works properly in all versions of Windows, including
Windows 10. If you have 64-bit version of Firefox, you should use the
64-bit version of MZCookiesView, because MZCookiesView uses the SQLite
library of Firefox installation to read the cookies SQLite database
(cookies.sqlite).

    Using MZCookiesView
    ===================

    MZCookiesView doesn't require any installation process or additional
    DLLs. In order to start using it, just copy the executable (mzcv.exe)
    to any folder you like, and run it.
    If you have an advanced version of Mozilla or Netscape browsers,
    MZCookiesView automatically locates your cookies file and displays
    the list of all cookies stored in there. If you have more than one
    profile in your browser, you can view the cookies of other profiles
    by using the 'Select User Profile' option. If MZCookiesView fails to
    automatically find your cookies file, you can still select the
    cookies file manually, by using the 'Select Cookies File / Folder'
    option.

    In the main window of MZCookiesView, you can easily select one or
    more cookies, and then delete them, copy the cookies information to
    the clipboard, or save them to text, HTML, or XML file.



    Command-Line Options
    ====================



    -cookiesfile <Filename>
    Opens MZCookiesView with the specified cookies filename.

    -profilesfolder <Folder>
    Opens MZCookiesView with the specified profiles folder.

    /stext <Filename>
    Save the cookies list into a regular text file.

    /stab <Filename>
    Save the cookies list into a tab-delimited text file.

    /stabular <Filename>
    Save the cookies list into a tabular text file.

    /shtml <Filename>
    Save the cookies list into HTML file (Horizontal).

    /sverhtml <Filename>
    Save the cookies list into HTML file (Vertical).

    /sxml <Filename>
    Save the cookies list to XML file.

    /scookiestxt <Filename>
    Save the cookies list in cookies.txt format.

    /sort <column>
    This command-line option can be used with other save options for
    sorting by the desired column. If you don't specify this option, the
    list is sorted according to the last sort that you made from the user
    interface. The <column> parameter can specify the column index (0 for
    the first column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the name of
    the column, like "Value" and "Name". You can specify the '~' prefix
    character (e.g: "~Name") if you want to sort in descending order. You
    can put multiple /sort in the command-line if you want to sort by
    multiple columns.

    Examples:
    mzcv.exe /shtml "f:\temp\cookies.html" /sort 2 /sort ~1
    mzcv.exe /shtml "f:\temp\cookies.html" /sort "Domain/Host" /sort
    "Name"

    /nosort
    When you specify this command-line option, the list will be saved
    without any sorting.

    Examples:
    mzcv.exe -cookiesfile "C:\Documents and
    Settings\Administrator\Application
    Data\Mozilla\Profiles\default\1ac13dos.slt\cookies.txt"
    mzcv.exe -profilesfolder "C:\Documents and Settings\User1\Application
    Data\Phoenix\Profiles"
    mzcv.exe /shtml "c:\temp\cookies-list.html" -cookiesfile
    "c:\netscape\cookies.txt"



    Translating MZCookiesView To Another Language
    =============================================

    MZCookiesView allows you to easily translate all menus, dialog-boxes,
    and other strings to other languages.
    In order to do that, follow the instructions below:
    1. Run MZCookiesView with /savelangfile parameter:
       mzcv.exe /savelangfile
       A file named mzcv_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
       MZCookiesView utility.
    2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other
       text editor.
    3. Translate all menus, dialog-boxes, and string entries to
       the desired language.
    4. After you finish the translation, Run MZCookiesView, and
       all translated strings will be loaded from the language file. If
       you want to run MZCookiesView without the translation, simply
       rename the language file, or move it to another folder.
