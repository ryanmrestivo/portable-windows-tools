Channel Number, and more.



System Requirements

Using WirelessNetView
=====================

In order to start using WirelessNetView, simply run the executable file -
WirelessNetView.exe
After running it, the main window displays the list of all wireless
networks detected on your area. The list is automatically updated every
10 seconds, so you can see the changes in networks signal. Also, if new
wireless networks are detected, they'll be added to the list.



The 'Company Name' Column
=========================

Starting from version 1.10, WirelessNetView allows you to view the
company name of each wireless device. The company name is determined
according to the MAC address. However, in order to get this feature, you
must download the following external file, and put in the same folder of
WirelessNetView.exe: http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui/oui.txt
Be aware that you must save it as 'oui.txt'



Translating WirelessNetView to other languages
==============================================

In order to translate WirelessNetView to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run WirelessNetView with /savelangfile parameter:
   WirelessNetView.exe /savelangfile
   A file named WirelessNetView_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   WirelessNetView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run WirelessNetView, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run WirelessNetView without the translation, simply
   rename the language file, or move it to another folder.



Command-Line Options
====================



/stext <Filename>
Save the list of wireless networks into a regular text file.

/stab <Filename>
Save the list of wireless networks into a tab-delimited text file.

/scomma <Filename>
Save the list of wireless networks into a comma-delimited text file (csv).

/stabular <Filename>
Save the list of wireless networks into a tabular text file.

/shtml <Filename>
Save the list of wireless networks into HTML file (Horizontal).

/sverhtml <Filename>
Save the list of wireless networks into HTML file (Vertical).

/sxml <Filename>
Save the list of wireless networks into XML file.

/sort <column>
This command-line option can be used with other save options for sorting
by the desired column. If you don't specify this option, the list is
sorted according to the last sort that you made from the user interface.
The <column> parameter can specify the column index (0 for the first
column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the name of the column,
like "SSID" and "Last Signal". You can specify the '~' prefix character
(e.g: "~SSID") if you want to sort in descending order. You can put
multiple /sort in the command-line if you want to sort by multiple
columns.

Examples:
WirelessNetView.exe /shtml "f:\temp\wireless.html" /sort 2 /sort ~1
WirelessNetView.exe /shtml "f:\temp\wireless.html" /sort "~Security
Enabled" /sort "SSID"

/nosort
