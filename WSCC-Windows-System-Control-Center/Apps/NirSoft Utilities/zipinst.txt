ZipInstaller v1.21
Copyright (c) 2003 - 2004 Nir Sofer


Description
===========

The ZipInstaller utility installs and uninstalls applications and
utilities that do not provide an internal installation program. It
automatically extracts all files from the Zip file, copies them to the
destination folder you select, creates shortcuts in the start menu and in
your desktop, and adds an uninstall module to allow you to automatically
remove the software in the future.

This utility was originally developed to install the utilities in NirSoft
Web site, but you can use it for installing utilities and applications
from other sources, like the utilities provided in SysInternal Web site,
Funduc Software, and many others.
Generally, this utility can install properly almost any software
compressed in Zip files that doesn't provide an install/uninstall module.



Versions History
================




20/07/04
1.21

* Ability to create self-install executables. (/selfexe command-line
  parameter)
* The 'Start In' field in all shortcuts created by ZipInstaller is now
  filled with the appropriate folder.
* Uninstall improvement: if a file is locked and cannot be deleted,
  ZipInstaller will try to move it into the temp folder, instead of
  displaying error message. (This trick works only on Windows 2000/XP)
* Fixed bug: In previous version, the configuration file inside the zip
  file was copied to the installation folder with all other files,
  although it's not really needed.
* New option: copy the uninstaller module to the installation folder,
  instead of Windows folder (UninstallInDestFolder value)


07/06/04
1.20

* Ability to translate to other languages.
* New option: Add uninstall shortcut under the programs folder. (If
  this option is unchecked, uninstall shortcut won't be added)
* New option: Remember the above settings for future installations. If
  this options is checked, the current install settings will be saved in
  the Registry, and they'll be loaded as default in future installations.
* ZipInstaller Configuration File (.zic file) - Allows you to control
  the installation settings, like changing the default installation
  folder, the 'Install For' setting (For current user or for all users),
  the product info (product name, compant, and so on), and more...
* With ZipInstaller Configuration File, you are allowed to install a
  software without any user interaction.
* Extra information about the installed software is now added under the
  uninstall Registry key: company name, product version, install folder,
  and description.


27/06/03
1.11
Fixed bug with the ZipInstaller context menu: In version 1.10, there was
an error if the Zip filename contained one or more space characters.

22/06/03
1.10

* Added support for more special files - readme.html, readme.htm,
  readme.doc, manual.txt, manual.html, and so on...
* New option: Allows you to add ZipInstaller to the context menu of Zip
  files, so you can easily start the installation process directly from
  Explorer window.
* Starting from this version: If ZipInstaller is failed to delete a
  file during uninstall, it allows you to try again, skip the problematic
  file, or cancel the uninstall.
* If there is only one EXE file inside the Zip file, and it doesn't
  contain any software information, the EXE is probably an internal
  installation software, so ZipInstaller asks you whether you want to run
  it.

Using ZipInstaller
==================

This utility is a small standalone executable. You don't have to install
it, and it doesn't require any additional DLLs. Simply run the executable
(zipinst.exe) and start using it.
In the first dialog you get immediately after you run this utility, you
have to select the Zip filename that contains the software you want to
install. After you select the desired Zip file and press the continue
button, ZipInstaller analyzes the Zip file:
* If it finds an internal installer inside the Zip file (setup.exe or
  install.exe) it'll ask you if you want to run the installer software.
* For each executable (.EXE file) in the Zip file, ZipInstaller
  inspects the version resource information (company name, product name)
  in order to use it during the installation process.

After the analysis process is finished, the next dialog-box is appeared.
The product information (company, product name, version) is displayed on
the screen if it's found inside the Zip file during the analysis process.
Before you start to install, you can change the following installation
options:
* Destination Folder: ZipInstaller will copy all program files to this
  folder. You can select one of the default folders from the combo-box,
  or select any other folder by clicking the 'Browse' button.
* Install for: This option is available only under Windows NT, Windows
  2000 and Windows XP. If you choose to install for the current logged on
  user (the default option), the shortcuts to the installed software will
  be added only to the desktop and the start menu of the current logged
  on user. If you choose to install for all users, the shortcuts will be
  added to the desktop and start menu of all users.
* Add shortcuts to the programs folder: If this options is checked, a
  folders containing essential shortcuts will be added to the programs
  folder under the start menu. You can select one of the default folder
  names or type any other folder name you want.
  In this programs folder, ZipInstaller automatically adds shortcuts to
  the following files:
  o Executable files (*.exe)
  o Help file (*.chm, *.hlp)
  o readme file (readme.txt, readme.htm, readme.html or readme.doc)
  o manual file (manual.txt, manual.htm, manual.html or manual.doc)
  o Uninstall program (If the uninstall option is selected)

* Add a shortcut to the program on the desktop: If this option is
  checked, a shortcut to the executable file of the installed software is
  added to the your desktop folder. If the Zip file contains more than
  one executable file, a shortcut to the program folders will be added to
  the desktop.
* Add uninstall module: If this option is checked, the uninstall module
  will be added with the installed software, and you'll be able to
  automatically uninstall it in the future.
* Add uninstall shortcut under the programs folder: If this option is
  checked, a shortcut that runs the uninstall module will be added to the
  programs folder. Otherwise, the uninstall shortcut won't be added.
* Remember the above settings for future installations: If this option
  is checked, the current installation settings will be saved in the
  Registry, and they will be used as default settings in the next time
  that you use ZipInstaller.


After you click the "Install" button, ZipInstaller copies all files from
the zip file into the destination folder, and creates shortcuts in the
desktop and/or in the start menu according to your selection.
After the installation process is finished, you'll see a new programs
folder with shortcuts to the installed software, like the following
example:



The uninstall module
====================

If you select the add the uninstall module during installation, the
executable file of ZipInstaller (zipinst.exe) is copied to your Windows
directory. In addition, a file named "uninst1~.nsu" is created in the
destination folder. Do not delete or modify this file. It contains
essential information for removing the installed application in the
future.

Whenever you want to remove the software you have installed with
ZipInstaller, you can simply start the uninstall process by choosing the
uninstall option from the shortcut created in programs folder. You can
also remove the installed software directly from the "Add/Remove
programs" module in the Control Panel.



ZipInstaller Configuration File (*.zic)
=======================================

Starting from v1.20, ZipInstaller allows you to easily change the default
installation settings by using a simple configuration file. with
ZipInstaller configuration file, you can set the default installation
folder, the default programs folder for creating the shortcuts, the
product information (product name, product version , and so on...), and
more.

There are 3 different methods to use the configuration file.
1. Load it from command-line by using /cfg parameter. For Example:
   zipinst.exe /cfg c:\temp\myconfig.zic

2. Put the configuration file inside the Zip file that contains the
   program you want to install. You must add the configuration file as
   "~zipinst~.zic", so ZipInstaller will recognize it and use it for
   configuring the installation.
3. Some of the ZipInstaller settings (but not all of them !) are also
   loaded from the Registry, under
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\NirSoft\ZipInstaller as the default
   settings for all installations.

The zic file is simply a standard INI file, and all its values are stored
under [install] section.
For example:



[install]
ZipFile=f:\temp\strun.zip
AddUninstall=1
AddUninstallShortcut=1
DesktopShortcut=1
InstallTo=2
StartMenuShortcut=1
ProgramFilesFolder=D:\Program Files
NoUserInteraction=1
InstallFolder=%zi.ProgramFiles%\%zi.ProductName%
StartMenuFolder=%zi.CompanyName%\%zi.ProductName%
ProductName=StartupRun
ProductVersion=1.20
CompanyName=NirSoft
Description=StartupRun
UninstallRegKey=StartupRun1
NoExtraUninstallInfo=0
NoSuccessMessage=1



The following table describes all settings that you can use in
ZipInstaller config files. Some of these settings are also loaded from
the Registry (Under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\NirSoft\ZipInstaller) as
the default settings of ZipInstaller.
For example: If you want that ZipInstaller will use your customized
"Program Files" folder instead of using the standard "Program Files"
folder of Windows, add a new string value named "ProgramFilesFolder"
under the above Registry key.

ZipInstaller utility only if you are logged on with administrator
privileges. Otherwise, the install/uninstall process will be failed.



Translating ZipInstaller to other languages
===========================================

ZipInstaller allows you to easily translate all dialog-boxes and strings
to other language.
In order to do that, follow the instructions below:
1. Run ZipInstaller with /savelangfile parameter:
   zipinst.exe /savelangfile
   A file named zipinst_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   ZipInstaller utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all menus, dialog-boxes, and string entries to the
   desired language.
4. After you finish the translation, Run ZipInstaller, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run ZipInstaller without the translation, simply rename
   the language file, or move it to another folder.
Notice: When you install a software with ZipInstaller, the translation
file (zipinst_lng.ini) is copied to the Windows directory together with
the ZipInstaller executable (zipinst.exe), so when you uninstall the
software, ZipInstaller will also load the translation file for using
during the uninstall process.
