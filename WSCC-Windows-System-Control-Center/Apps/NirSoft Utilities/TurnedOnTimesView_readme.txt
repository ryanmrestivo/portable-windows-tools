Description
===========

TurnedOnTimesView is a simple tool that analyses the event log of Windows
operating system, and detects the time ranges that your computer was
turned on. For every period of time that the computer was turned on, the
following information is displayed: Startup Time, Shutdown Time,
Duration, Shutdown Reason, Shutdown Type, Shutdown Process, and Shutdown
Code.
TurnedOnTimesView allows you to get this information from your local
computer, and from remote computer on your network if you have enough
privilege to read the event log of Windows remotely.



System Requirements
===================


* This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows
  2000 and up to Windows 10. both 32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported.
* On Windows Vista/7/8, TurnedOnTimesView generally works without
  elevation (admin rights). However, in order to get information about
  system shutdown caused by a system crash (blue screen), you should
  right-click on TurnedOnTimesView.exe and choose 'Run As Administrator'.



Known Limitations
=================


* TurnedOnTimesView based on a few types of events on the event log of
  Windows to detect when the computer was turned off and on. It generally
  works quite well, but it's still possible that you'll get a false
  positive, which means that TurnedOnTimesView will show that the
  computer was turned off and on, even when the computer was not actually
  turned off.
* When the computer is turned off improperly (For example, on a power
  outage), TurnedOnTimesView will not be able to detect the shutdown
  time, and the icon of this item will be red instead of green.
* If you clear your system event log, TurnedOnTimesView will not be
  able to detect the shutdown/startup times.
* On systems prior to Windows Vista, Shutdown Reason, Shutdown Type,
  and Shutdown Process fields are usually empty.



Events Used by TurnedOnTimesView
================================

TurnedOnTimesView uses the following events to determine the turn
off/turn on times:
* EventID 41 (Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Power): The system has rebooted
  without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the
  system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly.
* EventID 42 (Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Power): The system is entering
  sleep
* EventID 1 (Microsoft-Windows-Power-Troubleshooter): The system has
  resumed from sleep.
* EventID 1074 (USER32): The process xxx has initiated the xxx of
  computer xxx on behalf of user xxx for the following reason: xxx
* EventID 6005 (EventLog): The Event log service was started.
* EventID 6006 (EventLog): The Event log service was stopped.



Versions History
================


* Version 1.46:
  o When connecting a remote computer and the 'Use New Event Log API'
    option is turned on, the loading process is now much faster than the
    previous versions.

* Version 1.45:
  o Added option to specify user name and password to connect a
    remote computer (In the 'Advanced Options' window). (Only when the
    'Use New Event Log API' option is turned on)
  o Fixed to display error on status bar when TurnedOnTimesView fails
    to access the event log. (Only when the 'Use New Event Log API'
    option is turned on)
  o The 'Use New Event Log API' option is now turned on by default.

* Version 1.42:
  o Added option to show only activity in the last xx days ('Advanced
    Options' window).

* Version 1.41:
  o You can now send the data to stdout by specifying empty string as
    filename, for example:
    TurnedOnTimesView.exe /scomma "" | more
  o Added /RunAsAdmin command-line option for running
    TurnedOnTimesView as administrator.

* Version 1.40:
  o Added 'Use New Event Log API' option. You should try this option
    if you have the latest updates of Windows 10 and TurnedOnTimesView
    stopped working. Be aware that currently when using the 'Use New
    Event Log API' option, the loading process is slower than the old API
    mode.

* Version 1.35:
  o Added option to connect multiple remote computers (In 'Advanced
    Options' window).
  o Added 'Computer Name' column.

* Version 1.31:
  o Added option to choose another font (name and size) to display in
    the main window.

* Version 1.30:
  o Added 'Last System Event Time' column, which displays the time of
    the last system event before the computer was turned off. This column
    is useful when there is no shutdown event and the 'Shutdown Time'
    column is empty.
  o When there is no shutdown event ('Shutdown Time' is empty), the
    duration is now calculated according to the 'Last System Event Time'.
  o When event 41 from Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Power is detected
    ('The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first'), the
    'Shutdown Type' column now displays 'Unexpected Shutdown'.
  o Fixed issue: Under certain circumstances, TurnedOnTimesView
    detected the turn on/off events incorrectly because the algorithm
    assumes that the events are sorted by their timestamp, but in some
    cases they are not... TurnedOnTimesView now sorts the events by their
    timestamp before processing them to ensure that the turn off/on
    detection algorithm works correctly. Be aware that due to this change
    the loading process might be slower and consume more memory.
  o Added 'Save All' (Shift+Ctrl+S).

* Version 1.25:
  o TurnedOnTimesView now reads archive log files also on a remote
    computer ( from \\Computer\Admin$\System32\Winevt\Logs).
  o You can now choose whether to read the archive log files in the
    'Advanced Options' window.

* Version 1.20:
  o TurnedOnTimesView now scans events of computer sleep/resume and
    treats them like turn-off/turn-on events (The 'Shutdown Type'
    displayed for these events is 'Sleep').
  o You can turn off this feature from the 'Advanced Options' window
    ('Consider the sleep/resume events as turn off/on' ).

* Version 1.15:
  o TurnedOnTimesView now reads archive log files
    (Archive-System-*.evtx) when using the external disk mode and local
    computer mode. Be aware that in order to read archive log files from
    local computer you have to run TurnedOnTimesView as Administrator.
  o Added 'Run As Administrator' option (Ctrl+F11).

* Version 1.12:
  o TurnedOnTimesView now displays the computer name (local or
    remote) in the window title.

* Version 1.11:
  o Fixed to display date/time properly according to daylight saving
    time settings.

* Version 1.10:
  o Added new command-line options: /Source , /RemoteComputer ,
    /ExternalFolder
  o The settings of the 'Advanced Options' window are now saved to
    the .cfg file.

* Version 1.06:
  o Added browse button in the 'Advanced Options' window to choose
    the external folder.

* Version 1.05:
  o Added option to read the data from external disk (In 'Advanced
    Options' window). You should specify the location of the event log
    folder on the external drive ( C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs on
    Windows Vista/7/8 or C:\WINDOWS\system32\config on older systems)

* Version 1.00 - First release.
