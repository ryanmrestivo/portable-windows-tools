Description
===========

CountryTraceRoute is a Traceroute utility, similar to the tracert tool of
Windows, but with graphical user interface, and it's also much faster
than tracert of Windows. CountryTraceRoute also displays the country of
the owner of every IP address found in the Traceroute.
After the Traceroute is completed, you can select all items (Ctrl+A) and
then save them into csv/tab-delimited/html/xml file with 'Save Selected
Items' option (Ctrl+S) or copy them to the clipboard (Ctrl+C) and then
paste the result into Excel or other spreadsheet application.




System Requirements
===================

This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows 2000
and up to Windows 11. Both 32-bit and x64 systems are supported.



Versions History
================


* Version 1.50:
  o Added support for IPv6 addresses.
  o You can choose one of the following IP address modes: IPv4, IPv6,
    or Automatic.
  o In order to get country/city and ASN information for IPv6
    addresses, simply download the desired IPv6 files from
    https://github.com/sapics/ip-location-db and put them in the same
    folder of CountryTraceRoute.exe with their original filename. (For
    example: asn-country-ipv6.csv , asn-ipv6.csv)
  o Added 'Copy IP Addresses' option, which copies the IP addresses
    of the selected items to the clipboard.

* Version 1.40:
  o Added support for using the IP-Location files from
    https://github.com/sapics/ip-location-db.
  o You can use all 3 types of CSV files: Country, City, and ASN.
  o In order to use these files, simply download the desired files
    and put them in the same folder of CountryTraceRoute.exe with their
    original filename (For example: asn-country-ipv4.csv , asn-ipv4.csv)
  o Updated the internal IP location database.

* Version 1.33:
  o Fixed bug: CountryTraceRoute failed to display the TTL value if
    the first query was failed.

    GeoLite2-City-Locations-en.csv
  o Be aware that the loading process of the GeoLite2 City database
    is quite slow.
  o Added support for GeoLite2 ASN database in CSV format. In order
    to use it, copy GeoLite2-ASN-Blocks-IPv4.csv into the folder of
    CountryTraceRoute.exe and CountryTraceRoute will load it
    automatically and display the information of every IP address in the
    'ASN' and 'Company Name' columns.

* Version 1.28:

Start Using CountryTraceRoute
=============================

CountryTraceRoute doesn't require any installation process or additional
dll files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
CountryTraceRoute.exe

In the main window of CountryTraceRoute, type the desired host name or IP
address, the maximum number of hops, the timeout value in milliseconds,
and then press the 'Go' button (or press the Enter key) to start the
traceroute.



Using External IP-Location Files
================================

Starting from version 1.40, you can use the IP-Location files from
https://github.com/sapics/ip-location-db.
You can use all 3 types of CSV files: Country, City, and ASN. In order to
start using these files, simply download the desired files and put them
in the same folder of CountryTraceRoute.exe with their original filename
(For example: asn-country-ipv4.csv , asn-ipv4.csv)
When you run CountryTraceRoute.exe, it automatically loads these files
and uses them to display country/city/ASN information for every IP
address.



Using GeoLite2 City database
============================

The GeoLite City database is much larger than the internal IP-Country
database and for many IP addresses, it also contains city information.
You can download the database from this Web site. You should download the
GeoLite2 City database in CSV format because CountryTraceRoute can only
read this file format.

In order to starting using this database, simply extract the IPv4 file
(GeoLite2-City-Blocks-IPv4.csv) and the location file
(GeoLite2-City-Locations-en.csv) into the folder where
CountryTraceRoute.exe is located, and it'll automatically be loaded when
you run the CountryTraceRoute tool.

CountryTraceRoute also supports the GeoLite2 ASN Database in CSV format.
In order to use it, extract the files into the folder of
CountryTraceRoute.exe and CountryTraceRoute will automatically fill the
'ASN' and 'Company Name' columns.



Command-Line Options
====================



/Start <HostName>
Starts the Traceroute with the specified host name, for example:
CountryTraceRoute.exe /Start www.google.com

/MaxHops <Number>
Specifies the maximum number of hops.

/Timeout <Number>
Specifies the timeout value in milliseconds.



Translating CountryTraceRoute to other languages
================================================

In order to translate CountryTraceRoute to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run CountryTraceRoute with /savelangfile parameter:
   CountryTraceRoute.exe /savelangfile
   A file named CountryTraceRoute_lng.ini will be created in the folder
   of CountryTraceRoute utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run CountryTraceRoute, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run CountryTraceRoute without the translation, simply
   rename the language file, or move it to another folder.
