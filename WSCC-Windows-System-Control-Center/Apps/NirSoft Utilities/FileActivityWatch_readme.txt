timestamp, and the name/ID of the process responsible for the file
operation.

    the same sorting menu item, it'll switch between ascending and

    the process (Only when the 'Process Grouping' option is 'Group by
    process ID').

* Version 1.60:
  o Added 'Drives Summary' option to the 'Files/Folders Mode' option,
    which allows you to display a summary of all activity of a drive in
    one item, instead of displaying every filename separately.
  o Fixed to display the drive letter properly when USB drive is
    inserted while FileActivityWatch is active.

* Version 1.55:
  o Added 'Files/Folders Mode' to the 'Advanced Options' window,
    which allows you to display a summary of all activity of a folder in
    one item, instead of displaying every filename separately.

* Version 1.50:
  o You can now choose the unit of the Read/Write Bytes columns:
    Bytes, kB, KiB, MB, MiB.

* Version 1.45:
  o You can set any variable appears saved in the .cfg file from
    command-line. For example, this command set a filter to display only
    file operations of .txt files :
    FileActivityWatch.exe /FilenameFilterMode 1 /FilenameFilterStr "*.txt"
  o Added 'Align Numeric Columns To Right' option (It's turned on by
    default).

   of FileActivityWatch utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
