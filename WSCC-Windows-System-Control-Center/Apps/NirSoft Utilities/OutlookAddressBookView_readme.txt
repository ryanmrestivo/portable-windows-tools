Start Using OutlookAddressBookView
==================================

OutlookAddressBookView doesn't require any installation process or
additional dll files. In order to start using it, simply run the
executable file - OutlookAddressBookView.exe
After you run OutlookAddressBookView, it automatically scans your default
Outlook profile and displays the address books stored in it. You can
choose another Outlook profile from the Advanced Options window (F9)
In the combo-box located below the toolbar of OutlookAddressBookView
window, you can choose the desired address book to load. For PST based
profiles, you'll probably find only one address book named 'Contacts'.
For profiles connected to Microsoft Exchange Server, you'll get more
types of address books, for example: 'Global Address Book', 'All Users',
'All Employees', and so on.
On Outlook 2010, you'll also get the 'Suggested Contacts' address book.

You can easily select one or more recipients in your address book, and
then save them into tab-delimited/comma-delimited/xml/html file, by using
the 'Save Selected Items' option. You can also copy the selected
recipients into the clipboard (Ctrl+C) and then paste them into Excel.



Custom Context Menu
===================

Starting from version 2.40, you can add your own custom menu items into
the context menu of OutlookAddressBookView.
In order to do this, you have to exit completely from
OutlookAddressBookView and then edit the OutlookAddressBookView.cfg file,
located in the same folder of `.exe. You can edit
OutlookAddressBookView.cfg with notepad or any other text editor.

The structure of the custom menu configuration is very simple, and looks
like this:


[CustomMenu]
Caption0=Menu Caption
Command0=Menu Command
Caption1=Menu Caption
Command1=Menu Command
Caption2=Menu Caption
Command2=Menu Command
.
.
.



You can create up to 10 different menu items (from 0 to 9). The command
string is an executable file with parameters that provide the information
about the selected items.
For example, the following menu item will open a new message window in
Outlook with the email address of the selected item.


[CustomMenu]
Caption0=New Message In Outlook
Command0=Outlook.exe -c IPM.Note /m "%EmailAddress%"


OutlookAddressBookView will replace the %EmailAddress% variable with the
email address of the selected address book item. You can use the
following variables for the custom menu command (They are identical to
the column names, but without the space characters): %EmailAddress%
%DisplayName% %AddressType% %CreatedTime% %ModifiedTime% %GivenName%
%Surname% %MiddleName% %Title% %Company% %BusinessStreetAddress%
%BusinessPostalCode% %BusinessStateProvince% %BusinessCity%
%BusinessCountry% %CellularNumber% %OfficeNumber% %OfficeNumber2%
%PrimaryFax% %BusinessFax% %BusinessHomepage% %OfficeLocation%
%DepartmentName% %HomeNumber% %HomeNumber2% %HomeFax% %HomeCity%
%StreetAddress% %PostalCode% %StateProvince% %Country% %EntryID% %Alias%
%ExchangeString% %RecordType% %ManagerName%



Command-Line Options
====================



/AddressBookName <Name>
Specifies the address book name to save with the save command-line
options (/stab, /scomma, and so on)
If you don't specify this parameter, all address books will be saved into
the file.
For example:
OutlookAddressBookView.exe /stab "c:\temp\addrbook1.txt" /AddressBookName
"Global Address List"

/OutlookProfile <Mode>
Specifies the Outlook profile mode.
1 = Use default Outlook profile
2 = Choose the desired profile from Outlook profile dialog-box
3 = Use the Outlook profile specified in /OutlookProfileString parameter.

/OutlookProfileString <Name>
Specified the desired Outlook profile name when OutlookProfile is 3.
For example:
OutlookAddressBookView /OutlookProfile 3 /OutlookProfileString "NirSoft"

/cfg <Filename>
Start OutlookAddressBookView with the specified configuration file. For
example:
OutlookAddressBookView.exe /cfg "c:\config\oabv.cfg"
OutlookAddressBookView.exe /cfg "%AppData%\OutlookAddressBookView.cfg"

/stext <Filename>
Save the address book records into a regular text file.

/stab <Filename>

/stabular <Filename>

/sjson <Filename>

/SaveDirect
Save the address book records in SaveDirect mode. For using with the
other save command-line options ( /scomma, /stab, /sxml, and so on...)
When you use the SaveDirect mode, the address book records are saved
directly to the disk, without loading them into the memory first.

/sort <column>
This command-line option can be used with other save options for sorting
by the desired column. If you don't specify this option, the list is
sorted according to the last sort that you made from the user interface.
The <column> parameter can specify the column index (0 for the first
column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the name of the column,
like "Email Address" and "Display Name". You can specify the '~' prefix
character (e.g: "~Email Address") if you want to sort in descending
order. You can put multiple /sort in the command-line if you want to sort
by multiple columns.

Examples:
OutlookAddressBookView.exe /shtml "f:\temp\addrbook.html" /sort 2 /sort ~1
OutlookAddressBookView.exe /shtml "f:\temp\addrbook.html" /sort "Address
Type" /sort "Display Name"

/Columns <Comma Delimited Columns List>
Allows you to set the columns to display or the columns to export from
command-line. You have to specify the column names, delimited by comma,
for example:
OutlookAddressBookView.exe /scomma c:\temp\contacts-list.csv /Columns
"Display Name,Address Type,Email Address,Title,Company"

You can also specify the column names without space characters, for
example:
OutlookAddressBookView.exe /Columns
"DisplayName,AddressType,EmailAddress,Title,Company"

/SaveAddressBooks <Filename>
Save the names of all address books into a file.



Translating OutlookAddressBookView to other languages
=====================================================

In order to translate OutlookAddressBookView to other language, follow
the instructions below:
1. Run OutlookAddressBookView with /savelangfile parameter:
   OutlookAddressBookView.exe /savelangfile
   A file named OutlookAddressBookView_lng.ini will be created in the
   folder of OutlookAddressBookView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run OutlookAddressBookView, and
   all translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run OutlookAddressBookView without the translation,
   simply rename the language file, or move it to another folder.
