Description

NetRouteView is a GUI alternative to the standard route utility
(Route.exe) of Windows operating system. It displays the list of all
routes on your current network, including the destination, mask, gateway,
interface IP address, metric value, type, protocol, age (in seconds),
interface name, and the MAC address.
NetRouteView also allows you to easily add new routes, as well as to
remove or modify existing static routes.

Using NetRouteView
==================

NetRouteView doesn't require any installation process or additional dll
files. In order to start using it, simply copy the executable file
(NetRouteView.exe) to any folder you like, and run it.
The main window of NetRouteView displays the list of all your network
routes, like the 'print' command in the route utility of Windows. You can
select a single route and then delete it (Del key) or modify it (Ctrl+M).
Be aware that only routes with 'Static Route' value in the Protocol
column, can be deleted or modified. You can also add a new route by using
'New Route' option (Ctrl+N).

Notice: If you are using NetRouteView on Windows 7/Vista/2008 with UAC
turned on, you must right-click on NetRouteView.exe and choose 'Run As
Administrator' in order to be able to add, remove, or delete network
routes.



Using The 'Switch Metric Values' Option
=======================================

If you have more than one network adapters with Internet connection, the
'Metric' value is used to determine which Internet connection will be
used by default. (The operating system always use the route with lower
Metric value)
If you want to switch to the other network adapter, simply select both
network routes of these adapters, and then use the 'Switch Metric Values'
option. After the metric switching, the internet connection of the other
network adapter will be used.

===========================================

In order to translate NetRouteView to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run NetRouteView with /savelangfile parameter:
   NetRouteView.exe /savelangfile
   A file named NetRouteView_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   NetRouteView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.

   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
