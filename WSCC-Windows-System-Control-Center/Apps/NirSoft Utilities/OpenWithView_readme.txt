Description
===========

OpenWithView is a small utility that displays the list of all available
applications in the 'Open With' dialog-box of Windows, and allows you to
easily disable/enable the applications in the list. When application is
disabled, it won't be displayed in the 'Other Programs' section of the
'Open With' dialog-box.
This utility can be useful if your 'Open With' window displays too much
applications, and you want to remove the applications that you don't use
frequently.



System Requirements
===================

This utility works under Windows XP, Windows 2003 Server, and Windows
Vista. In earlier versions of Windows, OpenWithView will display the list
of 'Open With' window entries, but disable/enable feature won't work.

  user switched to another application and then returned back to
  OpenWithView.

Using OpenWithView
==================

OpenWithView doesn't require any installation process or additional DLL
files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
OpenWithView.exe
The main window of OpenWithView displays the list of all applications in
the 'Open With' window. You can select one or more items and then use the
F8 key to disable them and F7 to enable back the disabled items.



Translating OpenWithView to other languages
===========================================

In order to translate OpenWithView to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run OpenWithView with /savelangfile parameter:
   OpenWithView.exe /savelangfile
   A file named OpenWithView_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   OpenWithView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run OpenWithView, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run OpenWithView without the translation, simply rename
   the language file, or move it to another folder.
