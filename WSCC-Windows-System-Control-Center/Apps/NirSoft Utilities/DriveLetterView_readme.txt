Description
===========

DriveLetterView is a simple utility that allows you to view the list of
all drive letter assignments in your system, including local drives,
remote network drives, CD/DVD drives, and USB drives - even if they are
not currently plugged. It also allows you to easily change a drive letter
of USB devices and remote network shares, as well as to delete a drive
letter of USB device that is not plugged. You can also use
DriveLetterView to export the list of all drives into text/csv/html/xml
file.



System Requirements
===================


* This utility works on every version of Windows, starting from Windows
  2000 and up to Windows 10. Both 32-bit and x64 systems are supported.
* In order to change/remove drive letters on Windows 7/2008/Vista, you
  have to right-click on DriveLetterView.exe and choose 'Run As
  Administrator'. If you run it without admin rights, DriveLetterView can
  display the list of all drives, but you won't be able to change/remove
  a drive letter.



Versions History
================


* Version 1.50
  o Added 'Open Device Properties Window' option.

* Version 1.46
  o You can now send the information to stdout by specifying an empty
    filename ("") in the command-line. (For example: DriveLetterView.exe
    /scomma "" >> c:\temp\dlv.csv ) You can use it only inside
    command-prompt window.

* Version 1.45
  o Added 'Search Product Name In Google' option.

* Version 1.43

    occurs on some systems.

    Ascii.

* Version 1.40

    Revision', 'Vendor String', 'Serial Number'. Be aware that these
    fields are only displayed for drives that provide this information.

    disconnected network drive on the system.

Using DriveLetterView
=====================

DriveLetterView doesn't require any installation process or additional
dll files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
DriveLetterView.exe

After you run DriveLetterView, the list of all assigned drive letters is
displayed on the main window of DriveLetterView.
If you want to change the drive letter of USB device or remote network
drive, simply select the desired drive letter and use the 'Change Drive
Letter' option (F9). If you want to remove assigned drive letters of USB
devices that you don't use anymore, you can select the desired drive
letter, and choose the 'Delete Selected Drive Letter' option.

Be aware that DriveLetterView doesn't allow to change or remove a drive
letter of a local hard-drive. Also, you cannot change existing drive to a
drive letter that is already assigned to another device.

If you change a drive letter of USB flash drive that is not currently
plugged, this flash drive will get the drive letter that you choose on
the next time that you plug it.



Command-Line Options
====================



/change <local | network> <Current Drive Letter> <New Drive Letter>
Allows you to change a drive letter from command line, for example:
DriveLetterView.exe /change local k: l:
DriveLetterView.exe /change network g: p:

/delete <local | network> <Drive Letter>
Allows you to delete a drive letter from command line, for example:
DriveLetterView.exe /delete local k:
DriveLetterView.exe /delete network g:

/stext <Filename>

/stab <Filename>

Save the drive letters list into HTML file (Horizontal).

/sverhtml <Filename>

/sxml <Filename>

/sort <column>
This command-line option can be used with other save options for sorting
by the desired column. If you don't specify this option, the list is
sorted according to the last sort that you made from the user interface.
The <column> parameter can specify the column index (0 for the first
column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the name of the column,
like "Drive Type" and "Drive Letter". You can specify the '~' prefix
character (e.g: "~Drive Name") if you want to sort in descending order.
You can put multiple /sort in the command-line if you want to sort by
multiple columns.

Examples:
DriveLetterView.exe /shtml "f:\temp\drives.html" /sort 2 /sort ~1
DriveLetterView.exe /shtml "f:\temp\drives.html" /sort "Drive Type" /sort
"Drive Letter"

/nosort
When you specify this command-line option, the list will be saved without
any sorting.



Translating DriveLetterView to other languages
==============================================

In order to translate DriveLetterView to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run DriveLetterView with /savelangfile parameter:
   DriveLetterView.exe /savelangfile
   A file named DriveLetterView_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   DriveLetterView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run DriveLetterView, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run DriveLetterView without the translation, simply
   rename the language file, or move it to another folder.
