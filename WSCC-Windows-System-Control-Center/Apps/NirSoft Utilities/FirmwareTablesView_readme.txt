FirmwareTablesView doesn't require any installation process or additional
dll files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
FirmwareTablesView.exe
After running FirmwareTablesView, it lists the firmware tables on your
system in the upper pane. When selecting a firmware table in the upper
pane, the lower pane displays the content of the selected firmware table
in Hex-dump format. You can also export the content of the firmware table
into a file by using the 'Export To Binary File' option (Ctrl+E)



Translating FirmwareTablesView to other languages
=================================================

In order to translate FirmwareTablesView to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run FirmwareTablesView with /savelangfile parameter:
   FirmwareTablesView.exe /savelangfile
   A file named FirmwareTablesView_lng.ini will be created in the folder
   of FirmwareTablesView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run FirmwareTablesView, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run FirmwareTablesView without the translation, simply
   rename the language file, or move it to another folder.
