Description
===========

Volumouse provides you a quick and easy way to adjust the sound volume on
your system - simply by rolling the wheel of your wheel mouse.
It allows you to define a set of rules for determining when the wheel
will be used for changing the sound volume. For example: You can
configure Volumouse to use your mouse wheel for volume control when the
Alt key is hold down, when the left mouse button is down, when the mouse
cursor is over the taskbar, and so on...
When the conditions that you define are not satisfied, your mouse wheel
will be used for the regular scrolling tasks, exactly as before.



System Requirements
===================


* Windows operating system: Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT, Windows
  2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows 7/Vista/2008/8/10/11.
  (Windows 95 is not supported)
* Wheel mouse
* Sound card.



Known Issues
============


* On Windows Vista/7/2008/8/10/11 - If UAC is turned on, Volumouse
  cannot work with applications that you run as Administrator. If you

  application that you run as Administrator, you should also run
  Volumouse as Administrator.

      10.

    - volumouse is just a single .exe file that works with both
      32-bit and 64-bit applications.

    non-standard title bars (Like in Chrome, Firefox, and Explorer
    windows of Windows 10/11)

Using Volumouse
===============

When you run Volumouse, the main options window is displayed, in order to
allow you to configure Volumouse according to your needs. You can always
return again to the 'options' window by clicking on the tray icon of
Volumouse.
Volumouse allows you to define up to 5 different rules for determining
when and how the wheel should be used to control the sound volume. When
you run Volumouse in the first time, it defines for you 2 default rules:
When the alt key is down and when the left mouse button is down. You can
accept the default settings by pressing OK button, or change the rules
list according to your preferences.



Wheel Mouse Rules
=================

Each rule contains 4 basic fields:
1. Use the wheel when: This field represents the condition of the
   rule. For example: if your select 'Shift key is down', this rule will
   be activated only while the shift key is hold down. You can also
   disable a rule by selecting 'Disabled' in this field.
2. Component: This field determines that sound component that you want
   to control with this rule. The default and the most useful component
   is the 'Master Volume' of your system.
3. Channels: The default and the most useful option in this field is
   'All Channels' - which means that both right and left channels are
   changed to the same values. If from some reason, you want to change
   only one channel separately - you can use the 'Left Channel' and
   'Right Channel' options. Starting from version 1.10, 'Mute / Unmute'
   option is also available. If you select this option, scrolling the
   wheel down will mute the sound, and scrolling the wheel up will unmute
   the sound.
4. Steps: The number of steps added to the sound volume for each move
   of the mouse wheel. If you increase this number, the volume will be
   changed faster when you scroll the wheel.
there are also more advanced options for each rule, you can configure
them by clicking the 'More...' button of the desired rule.



More Rule Options
=================


* Activate the rule only after... Allows you to activate the rule only
  after specified number of wheel moves.
* Left / Right Balance: Allows you to control the balance of left and
  right channels. For example: If you want that the volume of the left
  channel will always be 50% of the right channel volume, set the right
  value to 1.0 and the left value to 0.5



On-Screen Indicator
===================

Starting from version 1.10, Volumouse allows you display an indicator on
the screen when you use the wheel for adjusting the volume.
You can configure the on-screen indicator by using the following options
in the 'advanced rule options' dialog-box: (click the 'More...' button in
order to get this dialog-box)
* Type: The type of the on-screen indicator. You can select vertical
  trackbar, horizontal trackbar, or 'none' - if you don't want to display
  any indicator.
* Size: The size of indicator - in pixels.
* Delay: The number of milliseconds that the indicator will be
  displayed on the screen after you finish to adjust the volume. The
  default value is 500 milliseconds.
* Position: the horizontal and vertical position of the indicator. By
  default, the indicator is displayed in the position of the mouse cursor.
* Transparency: Allows you to display the indicator as transparent.
  Only works on Windows 2000/XP.



Non-Sound Components
====================

Volumouse was originally created for controlling the sound volume with
the mouse wheel. However, starting from version 1.10, I decided to add 2
additional components that are not really related to sound, but they
might be useful for some people:
1. Window Transparency: (Works only on Windows 2000/XP)
   Allows you make any window transparent !
   In order to use this feature, define a new rule with this component,
   go with mouse cursor to the window that you want to make transparent,
   hold down the right keys or buttons according the the condition that
   you chose, and then scroll down the wheel to make the window
   transparent !
2. Screen Brightness: Allows you to change the brightness of the
   entire screen.
   Important Notice: Changing the screen brightness is achieved by
   setting the gamma ramp values into the video card. Unfortunately, many
   video cards don't support this feature, so the 'Screen Brightness'
   component may not work in your system.



Using the mouse wheel when specific application is in focus
===========================================================

Starting from version 1.70 of Volumouse, there are 2 new conditions that
allows you the define the wheel behaviour for every application, as long
as the application has a unqiue window title and/or window class name.
You can use one of the following conditions: 'The specified application
window is focused' and 'Mouse cursor is over the specified window'. After
choosing these conditions, you can go to the Advanced Rule Options, and
type the window title, the window class name, or both.
For example, if you want that to change the wheel behaviour when working
with Windows Calculator, simply type 'Calculator' in the window title
field.
If you want to identify the application window according to its unique
class name, simply drag the target icon into the desired window, and
Volumouse will automatically set the right window class for you.



Creating plugins for Volumouse
==============================

If you're a C++ programmer, and you want to add new components to
Volumouse, and respond with your own code when the mouse wheel is
scrolled, you can do that by creating a new plugin for Volumouse. For
more information, click here



Other Options
=============


* Mixer Device: The sound device that you want to use in Volumouse.
* Display icon in the system tray: By default, the icon of Volumouse is
  displayed in the system tray (taskbar). When you click the icon with
  the left mouse button, the main options window is displayed. If from
  some reason you don't want this icon to appear in your taskbar, you can
  hide it by unchecking this option. When this option is unchecked, the
  only way to access the options windows - is by running the executable
  of Volumouse (volumouse.exe)
* Load Volumouse at startup: If this option is checked, Volumouse will
  be automatically loaded after you reboot your computer.
* Display this window when you start Volumouse: By default, the
  'Options' window is displayed each time that you run Volumouse. If you
  want to avoid this, uncheck this option
* Run Volumouse application in high priority: When the CPU usage is
  high, Volumouse may respond to mouse moves very slowly. To improve the
  performances of Volumouse under high CPU usage conditions, you can set
  the priority of Volumouse application to high, simply by checking this
  option.



Translating Volumouse to other languages
========================================

In order to translate Volumouse to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run Volumouse with /savelangfile parameter:
   volumouse.exe /savelangfile
   A file named volumouse_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   Volumouse utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run Volumouse, and all translated
   strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run Volumouse without the translation, simply rename
   the language file, or move it to another folder.
