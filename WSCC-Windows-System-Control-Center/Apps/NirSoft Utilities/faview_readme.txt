Description
===========

FavoritesView displays the list of all your Favorties (of Internet
Explorer browser) and bookmarks (of Netscape/Mozilla/Firefox browsers) in
a single page. Each line in the list specifies the title of the item, the
URL address, the created/modified date of the bookmark item, and the
folder name. You select one or more of these bookmarks, and then copy
them to the clipboard, delete them (Only for Internet Explorer
Favorites), export them to tab-delimited text file, HTML file, or XML
file. FavoritesView also allows you to locate duplicate URL addresses in
your Favorites/Bookmarks or find specific item by specifying the URL or
the title.

Using FavoritesView
===================

FavoritesView is a standalone executable, so it doesn't require any
installation process or additional DLLs. Simply extract the files to any
folder you like, and run the executable - faview.exe
You can also use ZipInstaller to install FavoritesView. ZipInstaller
automatically extracts all files from the Zip file, creates a folder for
the software, adds shortcuts to the desktop and to the start menu, and
adds an entry to the Add/Remove module.

After running FavoritesView, the main window of FavoritesView displays
the list of all your Favorites. You can switch between IE Favorites and
Netscape/Mozilla bookmarks by selecting the desired browser from the View
menu, or by using the toolbar.
If you want to watch your Favorites/Bookmarks from another location,
simply use 'Select Favorites File/Folder' option from the File menu, and
select the desired IE Favorites folder or Netscape/Mozilla Bookmark file.
