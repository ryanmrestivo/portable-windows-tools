Description
===========

NetworkInterfacesView is a simple tool that displays the list of all
network adapters/interfaces installed on your system. It displays network
interfaces that are currently active, as well as network interfaces that
have been installed previously, and now they are not connected (like USB
wireless network adapters).
For every network interface found on your system, the following
information is displayed (if it's stored in the Registry): Device Name,
Connection Name, IP Address, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway, DHCP Server,
Status, MAC Address and more...
You can select one or more network interface items and then export them
to xml/html/csv/tab-delimited file, or copy them into the clipboard and
then paste them into Excel or other spreadsheet application.

character (e.g: "~Status") if you want to sort in descending order. You
can put multiple /sort in the command-line if you want to sort by
multiple columns.

Examples:
NetworkInterfacesView.exe /shtml "c:\temp\interfaces.html" /sort 2 /sort
~1
NetworkInterfacesView.exe /shtml "c:\temp\interfaces.html" /sort "Status"
/sort "Connection Name"

/nosort
When you specify this command-line option, the list will be saved without
any sorting.

====================================================

In order to translate NetworkInterfacesView to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run NetworkInterfacesView with /savelangfile parameter:
   NetworkInterfacesView.exe /savelangfile
   A file named NetworkInterfacesView_lng.ini will be created in the
   folder of NetworkInterfacesView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run NetworkInterfacesView, and
   all translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run NetworkInterfacesView without the translation,
   simply rename the language file, or move it to another folder.
